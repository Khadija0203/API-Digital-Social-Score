indian naming conventions please note that the indian naming conventions are different the sons name is written first and then only the fathers name or surname is written hence the correct name will be karunanidhi muthuvel and not what you have corrected in fact this is a name name never uses indian always write their name as mkarunanidhi,0
relationship to other areas of psychology this section recently added is entirely unsourced subjective based only on opinion we just require a reliable source specifically stating these points it also seems irrelevant to health psychology too i will leave these comments here if other editors wish to discuss if no discussion i think someone needs to boldly delete this entirely unsourced section to the article thoughts please,0

note from the subject book r la prabhup dal l m ta and he did not have to flatter anyone support anyone or manage anyones life his mind and intelligence were free and dwelt constantly on his service to his spiritual master he saw his present circumstances as a preparation for a greater task before him despite his advanced age he felt that he had barely begun his work yet he felt confident he had his vision of a world association of devotees it was not an idle dream although he was not certain how it would all come about but he knew his duty for the present he would go on describing his vision the vision of his predecessor spiritual masters in articles and books but as soon as possible he should go to the west westerners he had concluded were not satisfied with a materially comfortable life devoid of spiritual understanding more than his fellow indians they would be open to the message of the absolute truth he knew he should go and he would goif name desired abhay lived frugally in v nd vana keeping exact account of every expenditure and every receipt he carefully kept a ledger just as if he were running a substantial business even though his purchases were only a little milk a few vegetables charcoal for cooking bus rides and his major expenditure postage abhay composed a bengali poem v nd vanabhajana its opening stanzas were especially selfreflective and personal i am sitting alone in v nd vanadh ma in this mood i am getting many realizations i have my wife sons daughters grandsons everything but i have no money so they are a fruitless glory name has shown me the naked form of material nature by his strength it has all become tasteless to me today name anug h mi hari ye taddhana anai i gradually take away all the wealth of those upon whom i am merciful how was i able to understand this mercy of the allmerciful r la prabhup da is here in the advanced age of his supporters friends and family left him broke r la prabhup dal l m ta another reference prabhup das most ambitious literary undertaking the completion of name was to be no less than sixty volumes he had begun in india in and all along he had been aware that he was attempting a gigantic task at an advanced age now name was giving him opportunities both for writing name literatures and for travelling and he was working at an amazing pace prabhup da is here in advanced age of starting to write his bhaktivedanta purports i guess in india it was an advanced age but not in florida,0

i bother to note the other issue because wikipedia is explicitly a collaborative editing system and making changes that as i said obscure the substance of your edits with lots of nonsubstantive changes makes the former goal harder there are even explicit guidelines against needlessconstant changing of irrelevancies such as this,0
thank you for informing me of this i spent a lot of time on my reply in the hope that this helps to resolve the issue i just sent you this email so i wonder whether you really had the time to read my comment for the rfc please do so first i am not familiar with wikipedia mediation quite hesitant now with anything involving wikipedia and think that it is better for wikipedians to read my comments for the rfc before doing anything next and see below how name has been vandalizing wikipedia email to name to username hi i noticed that you have been removing my edits generally claiming that this was original research while my edits arent original research in the sense used by wikipedia but reasoned arguments you seem to make the same mistake as userrspeer i would appreciate it if you would do the following a inform me whether you are an economist b inform me where i can reach you professionally c please add on the deletion review page in the section on colignatus that you have been deleting all kinds of stuff without properly consulting other people d please read my position paper the pdf listed on my talk page or available at coolthomasenglishscienceletters commentsrfcpdf e please note that you didnt respect the time out that i asked nor the time that i asked to formulate my reply to the students f please undo the erroneous deletions my regards name,0

talkname count of barcelona talkname count of barcelona might interest you name of aragon what is your rationale for preferring the late portrait of name over a contemporary coin your edits are predominantly changes to lead images yet you almost never leave an edit summary explaining them you also reverted my change without even knowing what contemporary means or whether a certain image was contemporary with the subject or not the reasons to prefer the coin are it is a contemporary artefact giving information about names reign w a caption and about how he was seen by his subjects in his lifetime the coin does not mislead readers about the times of name as the portrait might the silver coin on a white background is more striking than the somewhat garish portrait in lowresolution jpg format it is far more likely that the limited detail of the coin is accurate clean shaven and longhaired than the greater detail of the imaginary portrait the later portrait is one of a series of nearly indistinguishable royal portraits from two centuries later it gives us no information about name or his reign its sole purpose was decorative what makes the coin an image of name is that that is when it was struck and what for but what makes the later portrait an image of name is that somebody labelled it that way they could just as easily have labelled an image of any other aragonese king in your last edit summary you ask if i have to choose between two unreal representations i prefer the portrait but nobody is asking you to choose or what you prefer srnec the problem is that we have different criteria you think the images should provide information about the lives of the persons and be of the age in which these people lived i think the only thing to do is to give a visual representation of the person the article is to the information i think that a portrait even if wasnt painted during the live of the person is most valid that a little image carved in a coin the two representations have the same chance of not being accurate but at least one illustrates better than the other if not exist any portrait of this person then i accept a coins image or a poor drawing but the present picture accomplish the role and i think that it must be more time i already argued why the coin is a better illustration and youve just asserted the contrary do you have an argument why are your criteria better than mine really when i rebutted all your arguments in your talk page i stated my reasons but i do not want another long discussion with you i offer consensus would you take a picture of the first part of the thirteenth century both of those are improvements over the 17thcentury image but not over the coin at least one other editor agrees with me sorry im not agree with your second comment but i hope we have made a step in the right direction this discussion is already too long both images are the best ones that meet your rigid standard of closeness to the characters life either both seem right imposing your personal preference is not how it occurs on wikipedia i noticed in the message above that this is not the first time that you try to impose pictures on articles regardless of what others think you are not allowed to impose your will both name i of brazil and name ii of brazil are name they were reviewed by several editors stop with your edit warring name is aware of the threerevert rule are you youve reverted four times on both name i and name ii in the last hours you should undo your last revert and seek dispute resolution such as discussion on the talk page or a request for comment,0
blocking mardyks guess what loser know what a cockblocker is hahahaha m,1
i tend to think that when the list is longer than the rest of the article theres a problem either the history and characteristics should be expanded of the list should be culled i personally like the consensus that was reached in the tripel article between and othersmyself included we decided that the country of origin should be highlighted with the most examples there we did trappist abbey and foreign foreign includes all nonbelgium examples this way the article is an article in an encyclopedia not a list people can find lists anywhere and the article should reference this also the style statistics are bad when you say style statistics it sounds like a prescription not a description an encyclopedia should follow the latter and if the former is used a citation should followand youll not find a valid one for this style in its country of origin,0
maybe enquire at wpblacklist as to why and see if you can get it accepted name,0

now ive checked and unfortunately for true enthusiasts name does not call this work a true choral symphony he calls it in fact more a cantata than a symphony in the ordinary sense p hard for a piece to be a true choral symphony if its not even a true symphony there is evidence that name would have agreed with name and was using the term symphony in the title more or less figuratively roughly in the manner that name later used it in his symphony of psalms from ursulas biography p on of my ralph names most grateful memories of george butterworth is connected with my london symphonyhe butterworth said in his characteristically abrupt way you ought to write a symphony from that moment a moment well past the composition and first performances of a sea symphony the idea of a symphonya thing which i had always declared i would never attemptdominated my mind,0

edit war before ezeu and the other one insist on behaving like trolls read the article it says xenophobia is a phobia it then says like all phobias and links to phobias the first line of phobias reads a phobia is an irrational fear this is correct and xenophobia like all phobias is an irrational fear this article lacks npov and you are simply trying to edit it to suit your political views which is unacceptable on wikipedia dont treat me with contempt ive been editing on wikipedia longer than you and i know what the rules are more to the point i dont see any evidence that either of you know enough about this subject to edit on it the article should be reverted to something resembling my original edit because the current content is simply inaccurate and politically biased i dont see why i should be forced to complain about you remember being an admin is about communication and objectivity not trolling articles to ensure that your personal world view is expressed promsan,0

just dropping by i thought id leave a little feedback too a featured picture is not always put on the main page as noted by wppotd for example the seminude name was not used as it was found too cheesy wikipediapicture of the dayunused notes several pictures that were not used because they depict too much name or are of a scatological nature a featured picture rating is essentially indicating that the community feels that the image is of high quality and high encyclopedic value on a side note potd seems to be up to thanks for taking up the trace name,0

theres no bright line here like a lot of things you only know youve gone too far when youve gone too far for me telling me that wine is sold by the glass is one of the things that suggests that this article had crossed a line not only is this information irrelevant its not even unique to this restaurant perhaps things are different in your part of the country but in my experience every restaurant or bar that sells wine sells it by the glass i am all for having complete coverage but in my opinion this article reads like its written by someone who loves names pizza rather than someone who wants to inform others about names pizza,0

wolfram a hypothetic body that completely absorbs all wavelengths of thermal radiation incident on it such bodies do not reflect light and therefore appear black if their temperatures are low enough so as not to be selfluminous all blackbodies heated to a given temperature emit thermal radiation with the same spectrum as required by arguments of classical physics involving thermal equilibrium however the distribution of blackbody radiation as a function of wavelength known as the planck law cannot be predicted using classical physics this fact was the first motivating force behind the development of quantum mechanics wolfram referenced to eisberg r and resnick r thermal radiation in quantum physics of atoms molecules solids nuclei and particles 2nd ed new york name pp i think this also supports the must emit part of the definition,0

july utc well yes thats fine but the point here is that there is no publishers statement made about anything in that sentence the idea behind having a resource is that we copy what the resource says instead of just listing them as a reference if the resource says name at worms then we write name ate worms about tarnishing any reputation that isnt the point at all and about accepted practices in the publishing world this is wikipedia and the accepted practices are covered by what we call policy and guidelines since those came about over a long period of time and through the process of consensus about people keeping records of how many books were published i think you missed the point there publishers weekly magazine has a statement about the number of books among other things for example they are a secondary source do you see how thats different about the article on fip it hadnt any sources at all which is one of the reasons it was deleted the only references which it had on the bottom were see also references that pointed to this article here and other articles which were also unsourced except for pointing to this article here fip and acimorg are the same entity facim is also the same entity this is known having the same board of directors as well as sharing the same registered trademark acim etc makes anything from either of those web sites primary sources,0

that actually sounds quite reasonable keep in mind that ive been blocked largely to prevent me from participating in discussions that were already underway offwikipedia before i was blocked its refreshing to see some true civility for a change especially after having had four different admins block me actually its probably more than the last four without one word of discussion with me from any of them before doing so then theres the whole thing about much of the discussion not being aboveboard but rather taking place in the modern version of the proverbial smokefilled back room name and haukur were decent and know more about what theyre talking about because weve been involved in the same discussions at various times in the past even ive locked horns with both of them at various times weve managed to come out of it without permanent hard feelings cant say that for everyone else involved mostly however what ive much of anything not even remotely resembling civility in this entire process at least not anything close to civility in anything other than a highly ritualized magicincantation wikipediajargon meaning of that term its no wonder that so many of them never use that word without linking it it has nothing whatsoever to do with realworld concepts of civility as they use it your proposal was so much in a different vein that it catches me by surprise the fact that i am surprised might be a cause for concern,0

trevithj the reason sources discussing the negative feedback amplifier do not mention setpoints errors and comparators is that they have no more relevance than the stock market the remarks of black are perfectly clear and also make no mention of these factors nor do his patents they are understandable as he intended them the use of feedback bypasses the inadequacies of the nonlinear variable and uncontrollable properties of the largegain open loop amplifier as very easily seen in the gain analysis that shows the closedloop gain to be set at as fixed by a resistor divider for example by making the closedloop gain independent entirely of the openloop gain i dont think you fully appreciate the simple algebra that governs this circuit,0
its quite simple if a reliable source refers to ms name as an amateur cryptographer then so far as were concerned she is its completely inappropriate to create a category for the purpose of downgrading anyones achievements if someone doesnt have a particular credential the solution is to refrain from stating that they do ps if name was such childs play why had no one else solved it,0

in the name article the controversy is a subsection of another subsection presidential campaign of a section headingpolitics this has been my point over and over again sigh its not a standalone section just because it has multiple sources does not mean it should be included as a standalone point it should be a subsection of a section that says political views or sociopolitical commentary for the article to be balanced,0

the signature of the atomic bomb there are good reasons to claim that the catastrophical event of the atomic bombing of japan marks the shift to what we here term contemporary in regard of art as defined in the contents page per october or dhu alqidah or heshavan name may thus be regarded as the epitome of contemporary art except from this it is a problematic definition for a number of reasons first art by artists working both before the world war ii during and after can not necessarily be defined as more or less contemporary because of this timestamp contemporary art did explicitly exist also before world war ii as this label contemporary has been expressed as a mark of quality pertaining especially to modernism by art carrying an ideal summoning from the artist or his genius making some kind of composed expression of what in such case are to be evaluated or considered the spirit of the time reflecting or in dialogue with the contemporary world in the event of the artmaking process including its publication or presentation another trickster is for me that the concept of contemporaneousness also must be regarded in relation to art that specifically deals with contemporarity as it moved through time it is absurd as a norwegian to not consider name a maker of contemporary art his plays are distinguished by being contemporary plays and historic plays i sincerly believe that name was intending to make drama that also were to be transformed or may i say be transported by the unfolding of time the retrospective style of his contemporary plays is at least a strong indication for that his plays not necessarily should stay in the conformity of the 19th century i think it is possible to find many other reasons for striking out such a definition of contemporary art as this lexicalisation implies,0

bi you said you wanted to talk at the bottom of the lead section you have written its promoter speculated in that the skyhook concept could be cost competitive with what is realistically thought to be achievable using a space elevator but the skyhook is not competitive with other rotating tether concepts in addition the rotating skyhook is in fact deemed not engineeringly feasible using presently available materials regarding in addition the rotating skyhook is in fact deemed not engineeringly feasible using presently available materials that statement appears to come from ref on page the full quote is if the mass of the tether alone started to exceed times the mass of the payload then that was an indication the particular scenario being considered was not engineeringly feasible using presently available materials although the application might become feasible in the near future as better materials become available with higher tensile strengths at higher operational temperatures it then goes on to say as we shall see presently available commercial materials will suffice to make the hastol tethers needed the primary message we want to leave with the name is we dont need magic materials like buckminsterfullercarbonnanotubes to make the space tether facility for a hastol system existing materials will do so it would appear that you misread your reference the tether mass of times mass of the payload mass is the upper limit to the problem systems where the tether mass is less than times the payload mass can be built with presently available commercial materials to further reinforce this the conclusion to the report states the fundamental conclusion of the phase i hastol study effort is that the concept is technically feasible we have evaluated a number of alternate system configurations that will allow hypersonic airbreathing vehicle technologies to be combined with orbiting spinning space tether technologies to provide a method of moving payloads from the surface of the earth into earth orbit for more than one hastol architecture concept we have developed a design solution using existing or nearterm technologies we expect that a number of the other hastol architecture concepts will prove similarly technically feasible when subjected to detailed design studies the systems are completely reusable and have the potential of drastically reducing the cost of earthtoorbit space access regarding but the skyhook is not competitive with other rotating tether concepts and a boeing report on the possibillity of combining skyhooks with hypersonic planes concluded that in general the nonspinning tether hyperskyhook concept does not look competitive with the spinning tether concepts the full quote is hyperskyhook in zubrin proposed the hypersonic skyhook as a solution to the mismatch between the attainable atmospheric speeds of a hypersonic airplane and the orbital speeds of space tethers since the orbital speed of the space tether decreases with increasing altitu,0

how odd you attacked me before for taking a 0rr stance and yet you are trying to force me into breaking that why and why deflect from your own unwillingness to change it yourself by attacking me and medieval prose not at all that shows a clear lack of understanding of the evolution of middle english to modern english it would also surprise historians to be told that the time after the establishment of the printing press wood block and the rest in europe post 1420s was still medieval most historians end medieval with names death even looking at columbuss expedition happening around the same time as the publication of malorys work which was only a few decades after the earliest attributed date would make your claims seem rather absurd but yes according to you printing presses modern english and columbus are all medieval thats lovely,0

great this is interesting we formed our own geneologies during the british raj did we singhs we dont have a reference by any source during any rule referencing our royal ancestry hmm how about this link by an independent mohyal site which makes reference to egmy own ancestor name becoming a muslim and his ancestors name being exiled from ruling the mathura state and asserting his geneology of being a son of name for those singhs who didnt know name who was the great grandson of arjun panda the hero who famously defeated and shamed the opposing duryodhans army in the mahabharat tahts who it is the 14th paragraph i believe and that is from an independent source recording its own historical references which has no interest in any particular anti or pro agendas as much as here at the moment i apologise for disproving you guys here but it is a quest for the truth afterall right name you have a lot of patience for keeping with this article so far and thank you for being open minded and dedicated enough to see past the rhetoric and abuse here some of us here do appreciate your efforts whatever the outcome,0
there is definately a major difference between caucasian and white users slrubenstein and alun are definately taking a racist stance toward this article and both sides can throw up rules and regs set by wikipedia to hide behind and attempt to justify your points of view cited sources or not its obvious your point of view determines which sources you cite and or choose not to but this article as it exists is just wrong i believe wikipedia would be better served by deleting this article and adding a new subsection in the races and caucasian articles if it this is not changed to reflect what of the people on this earth consider a white person to be this obviously not including alun slrubenstein when it comes down to it the term white person cant really be defined its technically not a race and any references sited are going to be garbage as you can find hundreds of them from what could be considered reliable sources that directly defy one another all that could be done for this article would be to direct it towards a view that most people agree with or delete it entirely but as it currently exists i say again its a joke you can cite all the references you want and state all the wikipedia rules you want you just cant understand that what you believe just isnt what an overwhelming majority of the rest of the human race does and as i said before theres no way of either side proving the case for either side here as white people dont scientifically exist so since you guys are obviously the type that will fight to the bitter end for some worthless cause even though you have to know that most everyone disagrees with your understanding of what a white person is just do us all a favor and either delete this article since there is no factual ground for either side to stand on or just accept that the overwhelming majority of people see this differently from you get over it and let the majority rule on this article about a group of people that doesnt scientifically exist end commafest,0
the afghan government may not reward the death penalty for prostitution but the afghan people do this article is to explain about prostitution in afghanistan so it should cover every thing including how afghans view it or feel about it historically afghanistans people lived according to their local traditions each region has their own local rules that they abide by and much of the country hasnt been governed by a central government in the south and east of the country i doubt you find a single prostitution service because that area is tribal society and they follow taliban style rules,0

it is not disruptive and does not appear to be attentionseeking these remarks are just argumentum ad hominem arguments nothing more you have zero evidence of this supposed motive on my part and are just attacking me because we disagree on the article an unambiguous violation of wpagf is there a particular article im working to improve there isnt how do you figure what is your basis for this accusation have you checked my edit history theres lots of articles im constantly working to improve as any look at my editing history shows which flies in the face of this idiotic remark of yours there are entire lists of articles ive created and worked on seen on my user page including three articles i singlehandedly brought to ga status the arthur adams comics article for example has been expanded and improved by me on an ongoing basis for the past three years and is currently undergoing a ga examination process these inane comments by you do nothing other than to reveal you to be an abject child and a pathological liar one who brazenly attacks others who dares disagree with him,1
i havent had time to read all the comments but i just want to say that this article still needs alot pf work not only in wikipedia standards but also because almost every single article is written better than this one i mean come on guys we cant let the rest of the zodiacs show us up as a fellow pisces i agree that yes we are the best but in the future lets try to keep the article as neutral as possible even i can read the article and tell that some of the people who have been editing it have been self bragging on ourselves also there are multiple books printed that would be reliable sources for zodiac stuff,0

dubious claims about clearly nontransgenderd people this article lists a whole bunch of people whos transgender status is clearly wrong and others for whom it is highly speculative this isnt a list of people who kinda name theres a small chance maybe are transgender the ones who crossdressed for some nefariousdeceptive purpose and not as a life style choice clearly can not be classified as transgender and should be removed from the article completely the fact that mythological figures such as achilles were even added in the first place says a lot about the pov pushing of the people who supported it the only mythological one who might be considered transgenderes is name the real life figures who did it to disguise themselves to avoid something eg military service or even to get into something where women are discriminated against they did it for deceptive purposes as well so they cant really be considered transgendered the pope one is laughable and definitely should be removed the one about name is based exclusively on an accustion from a unreliable source if they accused her of being a witch should we have included her in a list of witches too also id like to see an authoritative source showing that she was even accused of it as it seems that its most wikipedia ripped sites and lgbt websites that site that as fact and what are transvestite tendencies in reference to name you need to start citing sources or im just going to start deleting them that goes mainly for the historical and mythological figurse section name wasnt even a real transvestite he only did that so hed get a section and get kicked out of the army anyone who watched the show knows he would try all kinds of crazy stuff to get kicked out under the guise of being mentally ill this phrase describing the character is also very odd although a transvestite he loudly denied any charges of homosexuality whats the association between the two also it appears theyre using a warped definition of transgender here ive never heard a definition that would automatically include crossdressers as if that automatically means they identify with the opposite gender rather than just enjoying the clothes im sorry but this overly broad and incorrect definition of transgender is obviously an attempt just to make the list as long as possible june utc,0

approximately the article is factually incorrect etc on an don in the article are factually inaccurate statements about the confederate flag esp as underlying all those statements are a fundamental and flawed understanding entirely of slavery in the us south eg of white families in the us south never ever owned any slaves ever so imputing slavery as the basis for fighting in the civil war and so too the battle flag the confederate flag has that fundamental flawed distorted view add to that that northerners were almost the ship owners and ship captains that brought all slaves over to the us south and add to that that black kings chiefs were the ones who sold into slavery all the slaves that were in the us south and so on and on the story is one of fundamental distortion and of the of whites in south who owned slaves they have all been dead years further add to the fact that for of white southerners the flag has always represented valor in battle of the approximately white southerners who died in the war add to that the war began due to invasion by north and the felt view of white southerners that states rights then was the main issue and to a very small view slavery way below that esp as those of confederate soldiers and their families did not own and had never owned slaves to distort and warp all this factual history into black mania about the battle esp of valor being a rascist symbol further massively distorted eg by us media as cnn is simply put mass hysteria with no almost no foundation in fact please add all this to revise the bottom of the article which has those endless wrong factual distortions name name of ethiopia sr,0
good lord i mentioned the clusterfucked bureaucracy but i did not anticipate your adherence to it you deleted my post and it was regarded as vandalism when i tried to repost it one of the editors which removed my information was on trial for being a bot im not sure what edit war you are referring to other than my own additions to your page which you state at the top that you welcome your immediate removal of my edit was very suspicious to me as it seemed pretty authoritative are you on the edits to marmaduke subscription list i dont understand i do not think i am acting like a child if childish behavior to you is using bad language then call me a a child i suppose i did not call you any personal names and only referred to what i thought of as a hierarchy on wikipedia as a clusterfucked bureaucracy i can call your edits an ego trip which they increasingly seem to be as you want to talk to me like i am a child even calling me childish it seems as if you didnt even consider the several links i included in my last post inculding npr i am trying to tell you that i made a reasonable edit to a page one that i made before and which lasted several months before i noticed it was gone tonight you assertion that i am willing to bet no one will show you more sympathy than i will is further proof that this process is an ego trip for you if users are all equal than i would prefer it if you left me alone my edit is not inflammatory and included a link to the website if needs be i can include all of the links i provided on your page if that is enough to validate my claim that marmaduke explained is a relatively popular blog if all users are equal then why does your designation of my writing as nonnotable brand me with vandalism when i attempt to repost the content please explain yourself thanks yournumbertwofan,0

nrsv the section included the sentence the nrsv translation for includes this translation note other ancient authorities read six hundred and sixteen theres no reason to privilege the nrsv here over other translations that carry notes to the same effect particularly since the paragraph is describing exactly those other ancient authorities referenced in the note mention of it is therefore redundant it adds no new information this sentence is also a wordforword rehash of a reference in the lede about the variant i am cutting that as well since more specific secondary sources are already cited,0

lead whats there now is not a summary summaries are supposed to be substantially shorter than the text they summarize which the case at salvatore giunta is not it simply copies whole sentances from the body text as an editor we have to assess the article as it currently stands and not any hypothetical future stance if the article grows then the lead can be adjusted accordingly in any case the lead section i favored does indeed summarize the most important part the moh in any case did you read wplead the lead of a biography is not necessarily supposed to summarize the life story of the subject but assert thier claim to notability the two sentances i favored more than do that without being overly repetitive wordsdeeds,0

hi we have three members already we all seem interested in the project i have created a template to place on articles talk pages an user from the spanish wikiproject has just suggested that we translate articles from one wikipedia to the other using an automatic translator but noone responded yet one of the members is interested in writing about gay literature and there has been somewhat of a discussion about whether it should be gay literature or lgbt literature i believe this was the first discussion of the project two of us think that lgbt literature would be best i dont have a lot of time to dedicate to the project so i would like it if it didnt depend on me to survive and grow and be successful the other two members have asked what they can do for the project i would like to write something to better explain what a wiki project is for because this seems unclear i believe its not much of a big deal its just a way to have all people interested in the same subject in the same place so if something important happens concerning that subject for example a page gets nominated for deletion all interested people get to know it should also create a sense of community and its good to have that since well be editing the same articles i think things are going fine except that i dont know whether the other members see this as i do,0

midwest accent i see that you are deleting my corrections regarding the general american accent in the article midwest which quite wrongly implies that general american is owned lock stock and barrel by that region its nonsense the general american accent is spoken all over the north from seattle to connecticut you are going to have to come up with some citations which realistically and accurately show that the northern accent originated in or is unique to the midwest before ikk allow you continue deleting my writings without a fight it certainly is not unique to the midwest a region which was not even settled by english speakers until barely years ago after the northern accent was known to exist in places like pennsylvania and upstate ny and connecticut it really bugs me to see the midwest taking ownership of an accent which began in the northeast the original author blunders badly by lumping the accents of certain urban areas of the northeast in with the rural areas anybody from my region the syracuse ny area formerly albany ny knows that our accent it totally indistinguishable from that of the midwest i challange anybody to put a group of midwestern speakers sidebyside with upstate new yorkers and tell which is which its impossible its the same accent utterly and completely the same and weve been speaking this way since before the midwest was even settled so its nonsense to say its a midwest accent,0

alex thank you for your reply i could indeed use a break from this case but yesterday was a very eventful day as the case closed and then agk answered a question id initially posed on august meaning that he refused to engage regarding the false allegation he made against during the brief window during which i had a chance to respond to the fof and then when it made the response it not only confirmed the judgment on content aspect of the fof if begs the question as to why he cited another diff including an exchange with arzel in which arzel not only ignores the content of academically published rs he openly denigrates them in a thread where blocks of text of the formisano text for example had been under direct discussion regarding the perceived legal threat i had no intention to make a legal threat that was all sort of sarcastic play on words relating to specific sequence of events in the case starting with names comment on my fof on august to which agk refused to reply publicly until the case had been closed yesterday more than two weeks later there were also email exchanges between myself and nyb and agk which i will have to forward to name at some point after clarifying one point made by nyb on his talk page the import of the substance is firstly a pun insofar as i make an insinuation about sophistry in the legal field in relation to my perception that agk aspires to become an attorney or whatever theyre called in scotland it is secondly an indication that i have taken the time to register at wikipediocracy for future reference regarding earlier comments i had made about the court of public opinion and when did a little looking around there finding an entry about nyb for example who had advised agk that he didnt see any misconduct in some of the points of the fof so it was thirdly an indirect suggestion that he learn something from someone that is already an accomplished attorney if the reiteration of material deleted by agk from his user page within the past two weeks is outing then that is a policy i shall have to examine note that i am not the only editor to have broached the issue of his being an undergraduate in the context of his judgment and actions acting in the capacity of arbitrator in the case at issue theres much more to say on this but i need to get a couple more hours of sleep i have tried to leave links to relevant discussions at jimbos talk page but have only provided a partial synthesis of the situation not even contrasting the complete lack of an fof on arzel for instance with the response provided to me on the pd talk page shortly after the case was officially closed yesterday if this statement settles some of the concerns regarding my intentions and the severity of the infractions thereby diminished i would appreciate a reduction of the length of the block to facilitate my engaging in the necessary efforts to conduct the appeal without having to exclusively rely on the email system,0

question on possible citation im sorry if i missed your question i dont pay much attention to that page in response to your question let me start by repeating my boilerplate formulation the job of wikipedia editors is to verifiably summarize reliable sources using the neutral point of view i havent yet worked in no original research wpnor says that we mustnt integrate otherwise reliable information to arrive at novel conclusions comparing two lists and drawing conclusions from their differences and similarities is most likely original research we can integrate information so long as we dont arrive at new theories another principle to remember is that vagueness improves accuracy the more precise we are the harder it is to be accurate getting down to details the predators and editors website appears to be a reliable source so we can use it as a source the bauer site even if somewhat unreliable may be used in a limited fashion as a primary source about bauer im not familiar enough with this topic to make pronouncements on what would be correct however i would say that your proposed text appears reasonable the sources are sufficient and no original conclusions are made the website takedown issue is confusing to me but you should be able to summarize what you find in reliable sources overall my opinion is that the less we say about the subject the better attack articles are not encouraged while we must show our subjects warts and all we shouldnt enlarge the warts nor ignore their better features balance is a part of npov but you should be able to summarize what you find in reliable sources there no reliable sources only a he said she said blog flame war it is alleged the website takdown was instigated by bauer it isnt clear if she did and other factors between the forum and the ip are not known it was the root cause of this article and all the players here were involved via these blogs i dont see how that can be objective bauer im sorry i did not get back to you about the name stuff et al but ive been somewhat overloaded at work personally i think the article is better now than when i first saw it thanks to a lot of effort on the part of the primary editors of the article to bring the best sources and present them in a way that doesnt seem like a lynch mob yall are doing a good job and there should be enough editors on either side to ensure that something resembling nuetral gets posted im glad to help and try and make the article neater and i dont mean to sound brusque in the summary field but there was a lot to cram in there thanks for the note i appreciate it i would say name saying ive called her names is an out and out fabrication ive never done any such thing or whether its because hes been able to insult me and call me names on wikipedia repeatedly and without consequences ive accused her and name of carrying the water for tnh and absolutewrite and they have that isnt namecalling by a long stretch im really weary of these attacks over this this is mob rule while avi seems genuine shes hanging with a tough insulting tribe the threats against me are real and escalating by the hour blaming me wont make my points any less valid nobody likes to be piled on by a crowd its the internet equivalent of stoning this is not a fabrication i get awfully tired of being called a troll or part of a mob or cult or group troll or a selfinterested partisan or a blog comment commando or other things i could point at if i wanted to depress myself you also made a theoretical comment about me being nosy fat and ugly putting the word if in front of it doesnt make it any less of an insult ive tried to be polite to you and will continue to do so but this is the response and please notice like abi avi is name the admin abi the ml commenter who believes in kindness i counseled against piling on talk contribs those are not ad hominem names name yet youve linked to a thread where you and name caled me a psycho you should hear what she said in private when i asked not to be spoken of negatively in threads on making light its obvious you two are protnh and absolutewrite thats selfinterest and backed up by the fact that you run to her for counseling well avi can make her own decisons about it then cant sh,0

the punk rock page has more meat in the text and its a lot of text content then a photo so the glance is in favor of the text i do see some areas that can be fleshed out i think the hardcore page wouldnt work with every section in depth like theirs thats what makes this page also unique to hardcore but i do think that some sections here are too small and that would work to balance out the photos to keep the text the main teaching and learning tool i would like to resize the photo of zines a little smaller even if it has to be reuploaded then it might now be too much and too busy people read to retain information the right set up enhances that too many pictures are a distraction they take away from the knowledge more fleshed out sections can help ill brainstorm on that until later i guess add the picture if it bumps the others too far out of whack we can resize it or when the story gets fleshed out a little maybe it will balance itself out more the third option is we can fill out some sections more make it more balanced and then add the zines photo after so it accentuates and isnt the meat and potatoes of the section the sections of influence on other genres that could be good place to start adding more contentdepth ill study some other pages meanwhile when i get a chance then bring that knowledge here a little later thanks a lot i love to share knowledge and i like sharing that here for free,0

you are totally wrong the synonyms or terms of kshatriya and andhra kshatriya was and is used for only rajus but not other castes of andhra pradesh acording to anthropological survey of india by name which can be seen above and also in his other booksbecause rajus are kshatriyas and also called as rachavaru in telugu in medeival periodthats why name used the word rachavaru and also he is not an ordinary manbvname belongs to andhra historical research societyaccording to name they are kshatriyas who migrated from north india but not locals which is also supported by other anthropologers as the truth is aryans initially entered into indian subcontinent and stayed in north india northeast and then their castes ie brahminskshatriyas vaishyas gradully migrated and settled to south india no,0

wikipediamiscellany for deletionusernamesu hi ive just noticed that you nominated this page in my userspace for deletion at mfd a couple months ago and it was deleted tbh i dont remember what was there and i was just curious if you remembered the topic or how you came to notice it in my userspace in the first place im not objecting to the deletion although im kind of surprised that it was worth the trouble of deleting and to find out that wikipedia has a policy that allows for deleting of unfinished drafts in userspace i mean that seems ironic in light of all the total crap in articlespace that ive tried to delete but thats been saved on the theory that maybe someday someone might possibly come along and turn it into something worthwhile but again im not objecting or suggesting anything wrong took place just wondering how it happened thanks for any light you can shed,0

speedy deletion of namea tag has been placed on name requesting that it be speedily deleted from wikipedia this has been done under section g1 of the criteria for speedy deletion because the page appears to have no meaningful content or history and the text is unsalvageably incoherent if the page you created was a test please use the sandbox for any other experiments you would like to do feel free to leave a message on my talk page if you have any questions about this if you think that this notice was placed here in error you may contest the deletion by adding to the top of the article just below the existing speedy deletion or db tag coupled with adding a note on the articles talk page explaining your position but be aware that once tagged for speedy deletion if the article meets the criterion it may be deleted without delay please do not remove the speedy deletion tag yourself but dont hesitate to add information to the article that would would render it more in conformance with wikipedias policies and guidelines,0

i have removed the china section if in the future someone comes up with several reliable sources that state that certain events that happened in china from whatever period was a genocide then it should be included on this page but currently in my opinion there has not been enough scholarly sources presented to justify its inclusion it is better to have no information about a subject in an encyclopaedia wrong information i can not emphasize this enough there seems to be a terrible bias among some editors that some sort of random speculative i heard it somewhere pseudo information is to be tagged with a needs a cite tag wrong it should be removed aggressively unless it can be sourced this is true of all information but it is particularly true of negative information about living persons name see wpproveit,0

i saw this discussion here and needed to paste againnote that me and my professors are turkish so i think im being pretty objective hereislambol is just a myth about where the name came from but researches show that including the professors in my school say that name of istanbul came from eis tin poliwhich means to the city in greekthe galata quarterwhich is right at the north of the historic peninsula has always been the largest residential area specially for the greek inhabitants of the city because the historic peninsula was reserved for the sultan thats why the old istanbul was a passage way to the city which turned into istanbul in hundreds of yearsalso there is no documents about the city being called islambol throughout the history metb82,0
im not immune to anything if i commit a crime i will be punished by both god and fate no doubt it is hard to say that you have no involvement when a large part of the ani discussion consisted of editors that disagree with my position on the events notability criteria having a bit of fun and a bit of sport considering that you and i have engaged in that dispute as is demonstrated by the link above this block could be considered an act of vengeance on your part i do have strong evidence that his views are embodied by what wikipedia is not so are the views of many other editors i do not doubt that they defy these principles in good faith but good faith or not our principles must be defended or must they i suppose we can simply ignore them that doesnt seem right to me but if you think it is what we should do i guess weve not much choice,0

wikipediarequestsforcommenthistoryandgeography the following rfc was posted earlier today in order to end this dispute once and for all i trust that name will abide by the decision of the administrator who makes a decision concerning my dispute rossville staten island as part of an ongoing edit war has been arbitrarily reverting all additions of external links to the article as removal of spam these external links which had been part of the article since its creation are not spam and were unjustifiably removed one external link links to an article about the 150th anniversary of the oldest roman catholic church in staten island which is located in the neighborhood another external link links to a website created by a former resident who describes what it was like to grow up in the area before it was built up it seems to me that this name character who has recently been resoundingly rejected in his candidacy for name is not making legitimate revisions based on the rules of wikipedia but on his own interpretation of what is spam id like to request that this article be submitted for third party arbitration and i have exhausted all attempts at a compromise with mr name i will abide by any decision made by an impartial administrator concerning this dispute thank you very much for your consideration,0

silesians name i have not made any comments out of a desire to provoke you i have been editing this article out of a desire to ensure it meets the standards and conventions of the english wikipedia i am sorry you had a negative experience with the german wikipedia but that is a separate project from this english project assuming good faith is a fundamental principle of the english wikipedia i advise you to give editors a chance instead of assuming the worst i inquired about silesianpolish because silesians are sometimes considered a separate ethnic group i am not sure what you mean by reverting the article upside down my editing has been done to ensure that its formatting and style is consistent with other biographical articles as i do not anticipate being able to copyedit the article further i am removing it from my watchlist good luck with the article olessi thanks for you comments and in fact fruitful discussion you are right that the work of a person is most important however there are much present and past propaganda which destroy the peace if only some people would show objectivity and patience as you did it could be clear up to mention nationality is however important since exceptional individuals inspire new generation of a nation unfortunately nations or ethnic groups will still exist i have to hope for peaceful coexistence of them and fair competition seems to me that competition has to exit too best if for fun only i am conscious that english and german name are separate projects but you see when i approach german wiki dzierzon article the polish relevant article was attacked by some germansilesianpolish guy it cost me more then here on en wiki to settle the pl article well so sorry if you did feel bad about my attitude possibly i explained more my excitement with silesian is in short like this originally they were slavic tribe spoke polish as i mentioned for some to hundred years there were under german governments they had bad time as you possibly can imagine many of them married with german and wereare of course confused who they are you know the pressure on east of resilient nation and of course polishgerman conflicts continued finally in poland returned and become new problem for some of the natives even those who honestly considered himself polish silesians at the end of war could be persecuted there in poland was complete disorder soviets and communists arrived most of them real simpletons any way national government just prosoviet mafia was mostly occupied with fight against democratic opposition polish borders were shifted we lost some of our area and millions of people from east territories moved to present west poland you can imagine that most of them were not intellectuals at all some of them completely simple people they spoke different polish dialect also on top of this in the post war prosoviet atmosphere criminals found good playground well i do not know if you are familiar with criminal minds unfortunately i am this is like gangrene on fresh wound literally thus many of the native silesian could be robber in poland which they wanted so much i believe that in such conditions many simpletons could use the opportunity accusing natives to be germans now the present time some of the falsely accused people remember the tragic experiences and want rehabilitation and apology they could be absolutely right however there are many germans who want their property back and some just using opportunity to stir in internal polish affairs despite the final border agreement between poland and germany signed on november and governments effort to improve relations finaly i have to say i beleave that polish are hospitable and very often na ve not many realize that politic need caution those who realize that have a hard time to wake up the na ves some procentage remember lectures of history and objectively too many germans are toublemakers i am also convinced there exists something like national character you can have obviously you own opinion let me have my own returning to silesians it is something close to squaring the circle i wish the true silesian all the best but i do not want name on polish terytory in addition sorry if i used posibly ofencive reverting the article upside down that was in the heat of the battle wich i still have with name they just arogantly do not answer if they do not like and refuse mediatior at any imaginative pretext that sucks sorry and thanks again feel free to contact me any time you need best regards name december,0

thats the common expression on internet fora for followers of judaism and citizens of israel who push for certain issues to be seen their way the fact of the matter is that jerusalem is not the internationally recognized capital of israel its status is yet to be determinded in negotiations with a future palestinianarab government of an independent and unoccupied palestine the personal opinions of jews or israelis who want to depict the situation in a way sympathetic to them for obvious reasons cannot dictate the content of an internationally accessible article on wikipedia this is no propaganda platform and the want to post their minority opinion they should mark it as that,0
i was typing the response when you visited the talk page it is the nature of wikipedia to make a choose between users and so my comments were eliminated what i basically stated is that the material probably should not be in the article the reasoning against her nomination needs to presented in a balanced npov manner having its own section with each point starred is not npov also there must an attempt to provide the reasons for her nomination also that was not present also the comments were conclusionary they did not provide the reasoning for example the la times quote stated that she is bad whoa thats an elementary school argument there was no explanation on why jrb is so bad that is not a npov presentation so go ahead provide the arguments and thinking against jrb but provide the arguments and thinking for jrb also and conclusionary statments just dont cut it your contracts professor wants to hear why the contract is void heshe does not just want to hear you say the contract is void best,0

there are simply too many pedophiles who are talented at circumventing wikipedias good faith processes to edit these articles with any sort of information at the end of the day its antipedophiles getting into reversion wars with pedophiles hardly constructive linking name because its an authority on name is a wonderful concept if that were really the spirit in which wikipedia created content every article would simply be people talking about themselves the worst part about editing here is having to kill enough braincells to pretend that an editor like this is anything other than what he is there are not enough legitimate wikipedia editors to turn the tide when it comes to these articles good luck to those who continue to attempt it i shall go back to lobbing grenades from the outside,0
where is poland there is no reference to the polishlithuanian commonwealth i added a couple sentences despite the fact that the events were of great relevance to the poles and several battles were fought in the western part of the country the province of silesia was ethnically polish with german and czech minorities lied directly between poland and saxony whose king was elected king of the commonwealth a commentary by a knowledgeable historian would help the country could field armies of tens of thousands yet remained neutral when its main ally saxony was being destroyed while prussia grew on the backbone of the old polish provinces to attain the status of a major power,0

ekantik do you believe that name can miraculously transform his genitals i would appreciate an answer i also find it amusing that ekantik of all people is attempting to point out strange beliefs held by name when ekantik is a hare name congregational member and a gaudiya vaishnava who has openly defended his belief that lord name literally manifested seperate human forms married seperate women copulated with each one of them and generated innumerable offspring sanjay also believes that lord name held an entire mountain aloft on his pinky finger for days and nights and defends scriptures that say the lord name a male transformed himself into a woman name so it appears that ekantik and name are not really that different as far as strange beliefs and miracle stories are concerned i cant help to wonder why ekantik mocks strange beliefs when he holds them himself funny how ekantik and andries critics of name want to promote well sourced stories about gential switch tales and think the aura reference written by a doctor in a well known name newspaper is not well sourced this whole thing is pov and the attempt to skew the article with a pov is evidenced by these discussions good luck name you see what you are up against talkemail,0

penis envy from wikipedia the free encyclopedia name to navigation search for the name album see name album for the virgin documentary see name penis envy in nameian psychoanalysis refers to the theorized reaction of a girl during her psychosexual development to the realization that she does not have a penis name considered this realization a defining moment in the development of gender and sexual identity for women according to name the parallel reaction in boys to the realization that girls do not have a penis is castration anxiety in contemporary culture the term is sometimes used symbolically or metaphorically to refer to the idea that women wish they had a penis or to refer to anxieties between men about the size of their genitals contents hide names theory o criticisms of name s theory within psychoanalytic circles feminist criticisms male penis envy see also references external links edit names theory sigmund name introduced the concept of a little girls interest in and envy of the penis in his article on the sexual theories of children but did not fully develop the idea until substantially later in when his work on name was published it was not mentioned in the first edition of names earlier three contributions to the theory of sex the term came to significance as name gradually refined his views of female sexuality coming to describe a mental process he believed occurred in girls as they passed through the electra complex from the phallic stage to the latency stage see psychosexual development in name s psychosexual development theory the phallic stage approximately between the ages of and is the first period of development in which the libidinal focus is primarily on the genital area prior to this stage the libido broadly defined by name as the primary motivating energy force within the mind focuses on other physiological areas for instance in the oral stage in the first to months of life libidinal needs concentrate on the desire to eat sleep suck and bite the theory suggests that the penis becomes the organ of principal interest to both sexes in the phallic stage this becomes the catalyst for a series of pivotal events in psychosexual development these events known as the oedipus complex for boys and the electra complex for girls result in significantly different outcomes for each gender because of differences in anatomy for girls soon after the libidinal shift to the penis the child develops her first sexual impulses towards her mother the girl realizes that she is not physically equipped to have a heterosexual relationship with her mother since she does not have a penis she desires a penis and the power that it represents this is described as penis envy she sees the solution as obtaining her father s penis she develops a sexual desire for her father the girl blames her mother for her apparent castration what she sees as punishment by the mother for being attracted to the father assisting a shift in the focus of her sexual impulses from her mother to her father sexual desire for her father leads to the desire to replace and eliminate her mother the girl identifies with her mother so that she might learn to mimic her and thus replace her the child anticipates that both aforementioned desires will incur punishment by the principle of lex talionis the girl employs the defence mechanism of displacement to shift the object of her sexual desires from her father to men in general the offshoot of these events often cited in the media and colloquially is that a girl really wants to become her mother so that she can control her father a similar process occurs in boys of the same age as they pass through the phallic stage of development the key differences being that the focus of sexual impulses need not switch from mother to father and that the fear of castration castration anxiety remains the boy desires his mother and identifies with his father whom he sees as having the object of his sexual impulses furthermore the boy s father being the powerful aggressor of the family unit is sufficiently menacing that the boy employs the defense mechanism of displacement to shift the object of his sexual desires from his mother to women in general name thought this series of events occurred prior to the development of a wider sense of sexual identity and was required for an individual to continue to enter into his or her gen,1

history of primal therapy article i read through the recent discussions on talkprimaltherapy i also added two more comments to the talknamehurname page did you send an email enquiry the date for france ds marriage to name is without credibility after the divorce to vivians great credit she avoided the temptation to publicly humiliate namehur name after all he wrote in the original primal scream it is instructive to note that married couples who have both gone through primal therapy have never separated chapter and according to france d names own admission in the primal centers video series she enrolled at the primal institute because excessive marihuana use had broken down her gates so its a fact that name married a former patient my feeling is that despite being tagged as a stub the content of the namehur name article is just about right for an encyclopedia entry it isnt really the place to dissect names reputation i know it happens in other wikipedia biographies but in many cases it has got out of hand i agree with your suggestion on the primal therapy talk page that this kind of material belongs in a separate history of primal therapy article the conocer piece doesnt strike me as a sound source of verifiable information so i put together some links to articles which can be found online if you type emotional intelligence into google the no result is name eqiorg website he interviewed a former patient who attended namehur names primal center in the late s you can find his interview notes here labelled cautionary note names bio on the primal center website states the latest research conducted at dr name s primal center on the effects of primal therapy on the brain was performed by dr name former professor of neurophysiology at copenhagen university you can read what namen phd is doing now at hoffmanns website on this page you can find a transcript of dr name account of what happened to him after he left the primal institute name book name identifies case histories from names first two books that were written by defendants in the lawsuits against the center for feeling therapy name thanks name why cant you create an account like normal wikipedians complete with a talk page i dont think the history idea will come to much there is just insufficient well sourced information to make much out of it especially in view of cgingolds latest analyses on the primal therapy talk page regarding derogatory statements about living individuals i have already read the name swan song twice sad case you seem to be applying two standards of evidence the primal therapy article gives an outline of primal theory based on namehur names books alone which were written to attract paying customers to his exclusive and expensive private treatment center last september i wrote in the primal therapy talk page will the article have something to offer readers who want to know about stettbachers method or the international primal association or the plethora of copycat primal centers that flourished in the 1970s there is sufficient well sourced information available for a history article for a start two books about the center for feeling therapy namens bio and the transcript of dr name audio tape which was played a number of times at the ipa convention in the books by name and name are already referenced in the main article i have a copy of videg rds book by the way also professor name wrote a onepage account of his research with namehur name in lifelines as name had hoped it turned out that before therapy the quantity of these particular receptors in his clients platelets was considerably below normal within six months of therapy clients depression had lifted and the biochemical and immunological measures i was making approached the average for normal nondepressed people of the same age and sex further down the same page he added i obtained similar biochemical results when a couple of years later i did a similar study with depressed clients going through other less dramatic forms of psychotherapy so i suspect that in such cases the therapist matters more than the therapeutic theory having participated in the editing of articles in t,0

the marvels and mysteries of cite web hei sorry i didn t respond earlier was through all the material on using and the time got away only had time to run a quick experiment with cite webb before going out to meet herr professor name for breakfast and then on to do what must be done for the day but now that there is time to write this is what i understand using the cite web template assures one adds a fair bit of relevant information so that the reference is more consistent and apparently someone amongst our wikipedia friends rides a robot to identify new cite web templates and makes sure that they go into webcite to request a permanent archive somehow should the link rot as it undoubtedly will sooner of later someone will know how to retrieve the reference from webcite and repoint the reference so it is still live if this is a correct understanding then using is a virtuous thing to do and i will do it for this insight thank you sk l,0
i refer to peoples constantly taking the words of jimbo as policy the idea of removing any userbox with a political point of view is his point of view thats at the core of this problem you did not notice that an admin skipped over the tfd process and speedied something when there is no rule explicitly against having an opinion in a userbox rather there is jimbo saying there shouldnt be any i completely understand that he started this but he is not owner of it a foundation was set up perhaps youve heard of it the wikimedia foundation i didnt say you had that same point of view im saying that i was just telling the people who do to fuck off i made no attack on any editor that you perceive it as such is truly sad but such is life perhaps with time you will learn the intricacies of the language if one does not want personal pages on a site one should avail oneself to modify the source code in order to remove them from the site rather than complain that theyre being used people who overstep the proper bound of their position should die that i have encountered multiple administrators so far doing so does lead to the desire to fuck off but im not done here,0

re tigerdirect has always relied very heavily on rebate marketing and this has been true in the least for several years and their failure to honor them has made them as big as they are toda that is baloney that statement reflects pure bias you can go count the number of rebates on tigerdirectcom and youll find less there than you find on amazon or name or any of tigerdirectcoms other competitors regarding the attorney generals complaint you also have to note that in response to the complaint tigerdirect argued that its not true if you want to state that a company has used rebates in its marketing and has had public complaints about the fulfillment of those rebates then you can create a blanket statement and apply it to pretty much every computer and ce reseller in the country what is clear is that a whole bunch of editors have a hard on for tigerdirect those who cry about others povs and bias are usually the same ones who will stop at nothing to spread their ownwelldisguised under the heading of facts,0

elelland hello name i am sorry if i have placed this note in the wrong spot i m very inexperienced with wikipedia i was enthralled by wikipedia initially that is until i met eleland i noticed that you had some interesting discussions with eleland eleland engineered a small article which i contributed some information to be deleted he organised a kangaroo court made duplicitous unfounded claims and then set up a false consensus the article was on name fairfax publishing mideast correspondent the said individual has a unfortunate habit of mixing reporting and commentary he was amongst the candidates for this years hrcom dishonest reporter award despite being in the australia only catchment area so you can imagine the quality of his journalism anyway eleland did a great job of protecting him and got the article deleted so i studied eleland a little ive looked at over of his posts on the arab israel conflict more than were directly antiisrael his modus has been generally to unfairly rubbish the references of the proisrael side in this way he has undermined many many articles personally i dont care what his opinion is but when he uses his editorial power and influence at wikipedia to falsely invalidate delete manipulate etc i think there is a problem wikipedia is i am afraid beginning to read like eleland wrote the script who is eleland what power does he actually have can anything be done name if you post a reply here i will contact here or even by email,0

ive restored the page to the version thats stood for some months to address the anons concerns the revert restoring the criticisms of prime ministerial power section repeated nearly word for word information already in role and authority the revert restoring the list of canadian prime ministers section created a whole section for one link that duplicated one at the top of the qualifications and selection section the revert restoring the salary and privileges sections split an earlier merge of the two for no apparent benefit it also reinstated trivial and unsourced comparisons of the prime ministers salary to some of canadas top corporate executives note weasel words the revert restoring the living former prime ministers reinstated trivial information better covered at list of prime ministers of canada the revert restoring the death of the prime minister reinstated a list of trivia and moved back there information that had been shifted to the privileges section in all the reverts achieved little mostly decreasing the quality of the article,0
february utc absolutely amazing youre a total criminal i have seen what you did with my ayr and saleban revisions youre a complete and utter degenerate who actively deleted every single addition of mine on this website then you cry about personally attacking you well criminal for me to attack you you would need to have some humanity first but you lack that since youre a criminal malefactor i cant even find a better word to describe you that is synoonymous with criminal you think i care about being banned you must be mentally defiencent to assume id care about staying on a website where i cant even post anything let me tell you one thing you can edit the fucking somali people page and make it all darood you can fucking delete every single fucking name page on here but the current president of somalia is name and it will always fucking stay that way you darood animals have been limited and contained to the internet where you roam go to fucking hell thats if you dont edit the wiki page for hell and make it into a paradise fuck yourself,1
cannot decipher and punitive actions as to the other complaints against me i obtained a user name about the time i was being blocked for hours for multiple reverts this block was supposedly sent to a talk page that i never registered my ipa talk page and would not use if i could help it i would prefer not to broadcast my ipa later when i autosigned which left my ipa behind as a signature i believed i was logged on as name and certainly not trying to hide behind an ipa common sense should suggest that no one would hide behind an ipa since these are more public than a user name,0

list of operas by name thanks for this looks good but can we make all the columns range left having one ranging right makes me feel a little seasick also i see you are tightcoding but removing all the letter spaces around entries is there any special advantage in this the reason i use them is simply so i can see the text easier i find tight coding everything makes in much more difficult to locate text when it needs needs correcting does it affect the layout in some way i havent noticed thanks zach,0
july utc in the case of poland there were censuse both before and after the war and religious affiliation was assigned at birth and very hard to subsequently change birth registration was in the hands of religious bodies in any event the sheer number of eyewitnesses to what went on home army resistance intelligence reports and the testimonies of jewish polish and other collaborators as well as germans in postwar trials along with thorough german documentary evidence made the sad task easier one only had to look around to see absence evereywhere seems to be the survivors common testimony,0

its in the history or more conveniently in your own contribs thank you for the explanation but that wasnt a big deal i was more upset by your second post waving me off with a sneer about growing a thicker skin and a fingerwaggle about profanity treating me as an insensate piece of internet polemic rather than a fellow human attempting to give an honest account of herself an account which mackensen promptly removed as you say well i understand that trying to contribute to the workshop was a bad idea in the first place running full tilt into name after managing to avoid him on irc for a whole month to the immeasureable improvement of my quality of life anyway ive always seen you as somebody who stands up for the underdog i remember praising your addition of this edit to the harassment guideline and i was sad to see there was no mutuality of respect talk,0

provide reliable sources or your edits will be reverted heres one refering to a sickening terrorist attack in manchester do you have any reliable sources contradicting the above source since you remove the term terrorist from the article im assuming you do have reliable sources what are these ani i made a mistake by misinterpreting what had happened in this instance removal was the best option a slightly longer explanation is at the relevant place on wpani my apologies talk name ive made a new edit on the name article please clean it up as you please but dont revert the previous edit is misleading and portrays the idea that the army was made up on protreaty veterans rather than the fact that most of the new soldiers were not and its also an old cover up of the fact that ex british veterans fought in free state army which caused much consternation among the irregulars,0

wrong licenses i have corrected the licenses for the majority of the images you have uploaded the exceptions are imagewankhede mumbaijpg on the flickr page the author has apparently agreed to license the image under one of the free creative commons licenses but failed to actually change the licensing imagedhoom2jpg concern that the creator is in no position to submit the image under a creative commons license as it depicts a billboard for a film and copyright to it is held by somebody else than the photographer as such the photo may not be used on wikipedia except perhaps under fair use policy which probably doesnt apply or under panorama freedom depending on what the copyright law of india says on this topic imagebipashajpg image description page implies that it is licensed for noncommercial use only contradicting your copyright tag such a restriction is not acceptable on wikipedia in addition the link to the original source which could clarify which condition is correct of the image is missing imagename the link to the original source at flickr is missing author uploads images to flickr as all rights reserved imagechowpattijpg to verify that the image is indeed under the license you claim the author should probably email the wikimedia foundation and confirm that it is indeed under that license imagehydmalljpg the flickr page states that it is under a creative commons noderivative license a license that prohibits the image to be modifiedused in derivative works is not acceptable on wikipedia either imageinfobangalorejpg no evidence of the image being under a free license imagebrigaderoadjpg name page states all rights reserved imagehooglyjpg the link to the original source at flickr is missing author uploads images to flickr as all rights reserved imagehafjpg name page states all rights reserved imagebangtempjpg creative commons noderivative license imagekolkahomesjpg all rights reserved imagedelhimalljpg creative commons attribution noncommercial noderivative license unacceptable on wikipedia imageyamunjpg all rights reserved imagekolkjpg all rights reserved imagemyspalbangjpg all rights reserved imagebangalorejpg the link to the original source is missing no evidence that it is under the creative commons license imagelalbaghjpg taken from wikitravel uploader ought to confirm that he is indeed under the author and that he has licensed it under the license indicated imagenamejpg who made this image there are several issues here there are multiple creative commons licenses not all of which are acceptable on wikipedia in particular licenses that prohibit commercial use or making of derivative works are considered unfree and cant be used on wikipedia except as provided by the fair use policy creative commons atrribution and creative commons atrribution sharealike licenses are okay also there are multiple versions of the licenses creative commons atrribution sharealike and are all distinct licenses the problem is that the upload dialogue only lists the versions and not the earlier ones when the image is under one of the older licenses you ought to edit the image description page and correct the number as far as i can see name only uses the versions of the licenses in addition some of the name authors have indicated that they allow the image to be used on wikipedia without making it clear that they release it under one of the acceptable licenses a permission that only extends to wikipedia is not sufficient either you should ask the authors to do one of the following change the name page to license the image under creative commons attribution or attribution sharealike license apparently this would change the licensing for all images and this may not be what they intend to do post a message to the image page with a text similar to the following i creator of the image agree to license it under the creative commons attribution license link alternately under the creative commons attribution sharealike license link this declaration overrides any statement to the contrary on this page email the wikimedia foundation permissionsenatwikimediadotorg with a message similar to the above also specifying which image images the user intends to release under the license this would be the best choice if the author doesnt want to reveal his identity on wikip,0
you make some good points while begleys piece is a reliable source i agree that its problematic to give such prominence to her opinion you always end up with questions of why this commentator is being cited rather than that commentator however when all this is finally over next week with name report i think we need an overview of where opinion stands it certainly seems to be trending towards begleys view that its a manufactured controversy with no substance to it i suggest taking begley out of the lead and out of the article altogether for now and then readding her view as part of a summary of postmuir russell opinion,0

rants to policies hi i think that you should reformat usershaneswhy tags are evil vandalism protection tags or at least the idea into some sort of proposal to reformat multiple distracting protection tags to less distracting corner icons for example redirecting to well probably move the later to the former for this case the corner icons work beautifully are much less distracting and clicking them will follow you to a page explaining what the lock is for i fully agree that the large box with text is very distracting and unnecessary this is especially true when nonuser wikipedia users read the articles which probably constitutes the majority of wikipedia readers they probably dont care that they cant edit the article nor would they and of most concern they may confuse the tag with the article content thanks,0

peer review as others have mentioned above the tone doesnt seem to be encyclopedialike its more of an educational piece on what happened from your view in the opening section you write this operation was the result of wary parents under the newly instated name who did not want to give up their parental rights to the cuban government largely unpublicized for fear of being viewed as political propaganda this underground operation eventually became the largest recorded exodus of unaccompanied youth in the western hemisphere that is a very hard claim to substantiate without any sort of reference the whole demographics of minors section could either be put in another section or completely deleted because earlier you already state the children were cuban and their parents didnt agree with name so it is in my belief their religions and social status dont matter enough for its own section eo,0

response to third opinion requesthi im here to give your third opinion i think its important to keep in mind that this article is titled common english usage misconceptions its not common english mistakes according to professional typography standards it is clear to me at least that the hypen is often misused theres no dash key on my keyboard i know how to make a dash however but i do web dev and work for a printing company and i just started a sentence with but and this one with and i know all these things are wrong but they are convenient and im writing this somewhat humorous third opinion for a few guys on an article talk page so in my mind the question is whether this is a misconception or just ignorance i believe that to properly call something a misconception it must be believed to be a rule when in fact such a rule is not correct ive never heard anyone say just use hyphens for everything it has only become the default because we have no dash keys so i would lean toward excluding this entry unless you want to change the scope of the list to include all common mistakes not just misconceptions hope this helps,0

we do present the whole picture of a season here the question is how much detail is suitable for wikipedia car launches are trivial do we also want dates of driver announcements engine deals and there is basic information about testing or will be once someone writes it for this page so readers will know about the official tests remember that previous articles in the days of free testing the more recent complete ones anyway do not give any information on private tests so the editors were cherrypicking information to begin with out of interest what more would you even write for testing times no of laps we all know they are meaningless so it will even be somewhat misleading to include that level of detail as for name tables you mentioned above they were simply a duplication of existing information,0

name hi name i noticed you changed the date of birth cited on this page to what is your source for that im wondering because the arabic wikipedia article which this page started as a translation from cites his year of birth as while a book i have about him the one referenced in the article cites it as what the book says in a footnote on the subject is name the caricature artist name in the kuwaiti magazine alarabi no august name saw this date and did not raise any objection while the book is certainly not academic its also worth noting that amongst those thanked by the author is name the artists son on the other hand on this page name alali himself is quoted as saying i was born where christ was born between name and name in the village of name in the northern name and i was expelled from there ten years later in to ain alhilwe camp in lebanon however the same site also bases its short biography of name on the book i used and gives the year for his birth accordingly unless you have a solid source i think we may have to leave it as unknown by the way that site also shows a pretty cool pflp poster about his assassination i wonder could we get permission to use it all the best talk,0

hi you can unblock my page now before you level charges of harassment or personal attacks in the future perhaps in your infinite wisdom and expertise you may wish to delve into the comments and behavior of the one leveling the accusation for instance summarily deleting posts in a section that editor had never shown interest in prior making childish remarks in comments to said deletions indicating the editors lack of maturity accusing this editor of generating the very information he cited etc i find it interesting that i am considered a sockpuppet for supposedly having a political agenda and working for someone else but when i accuse the two of you of colluding that is considered harassment at least you are smart enough not to have a banner saying you prefer the metric system how is openly expressing political views on wikipedia acceptable yet inferring that i have some sort of agenda because my views dont jive with yours is grounds for being blocked just words and whatevers and his buddies martinvl arent so smart i bet they are both members of their colleges metric society,0

hi rpau23 i appreciate your comments and i agreed with most of them i realized after you mentioned it that i needed to change the wording of one of the sentences under the name heading i think it works a bit better now name hyperlinks for some key words was beneficial too however in regards to creating a hyperlink for name and ilya sutskever they are graduate students working with name and do not have wikipedia pages written on them so i cant make any links for them as for the picture of the name wikipedia seemed to give me a hard time for trying to upload a photo unless i had explicit consent from the owner of the photo i had contacted name previously to get some information from him personally but i got the sense that i was annoying him slightly as he said he was really busy and was terse in his responses so i decided not to pursue him for the picture thanks for your comments and criticisms though they were helpful name thanks for your input it was quite useful,0

disruptive activity please stop your disruptive editing if you continue to vandalize wikipedia as you did at paracetamol you may be blocked from editing name email yeah so i add two interesting and important new relevant references to an article which indicates potential harm to pregnant women on the paracetamol page these are removed because you guys dont like primary sources this is ridiculous and frankly an extreme case of what is wrong with wikipedia my wife is pregnant i for sure want to know about potential harm of this drug i would think as a medical professional that you would be more inspired by the first do no harm idea the fact that you wikipedia jerks are so focused on having only sources from a narrow range of whatever it takes for a given article is so frustrating ive continued to run into this kind of thing you would think that academic journals have taken over wikipedia the idea that i have actually improved the article with my additions and that others can improve it further has completely escaped much of the wikipedia culture these days wikipedia has simply forgotten the idea that this is collaboratively edited rather than having a coterie of people who simply reject all edits if they do not thread the eye of the needle through the dozens of acronym style guides you guys are disgusting really you are standing on the shoulders of millions of edits and now you reject the very thing that got you to where you are namely lots of collaboratively edited small improvements now any change has to go through hurdles that would never have created wikipedia in the first place the fact that you have excluded something that is evidence of significant danger to pregnant women based on this culture of exclusiveness should trouble you deeply im sorry that ive upset you but the fact is we get hundreds upon hundreds of poor quality changes every day that is why weve written wpmedrs which i pointed to when i reverted you there is also an excellent essay on why we adhere so strongly to it at wpwhymedrs the fact is that many primary studies are either performed on mice or on very small populations so that their results cant be transferred into clinical practise medrs is no catch all but it helps us and makes patrolling many articles and removing citations from the daily mail easier i would also like to point out that we are working on getting these types of warnings into our articles automatically for example by having fda warnings automatically added i understand it may feel as if youre being reverted by a faceless mass but i assure you if you had simply taken up the discussion it would have been far more likely to be productive name email this isnt about my feelings it is about your behavior you revert me with no reason then start quoting this bureaucratic nonsense then threaten me with banning due to my disruptive editing this is why wikipedia is dying cannibalizing its editors and edits in a kafkaesque farce congratulations im sure your nodoubt proper and uplifting zyzzyxrd will be cited upon its demise you may want to try and comprehend your own actions and not my feelings see,0

to sum up my thoughts shortly adoption is about helping out the adoptee not shielding them from attacks by people like you as an adopter i feel that i have gone above and beyond what my job is most adopters would not have taken the time to review lots of his edits as i did and start a mediation page where i am the mediator you linked to several places where you claimed i hadnt fulfilled my promises well i believe i have fulfilled every one of the things i planned to do but you from the very beginning seemed to think i was going to step in here and change mr names habits which have been going on for a very long time in a matter of days youve been in this dispute for so long that youve gotten more and more heated as weve gone along that at this point i would suggest that you just step out there are enough people already helping florentino floro that are in on the dispute such as myself that he will be taken care of let me know if you have any additional specific questions thank you user talkdiligent terriertalk,0
well name i have printed the paper and the condition is in fact what ultrapower says it is not your correction it seems that the paper is not incorrect but rather correct and pointless you have already identified the worst problem the third condition requires incontinuity of f at all integer values however this problem disappears if we consider only the special case ae so lets do that we want a function f satisfying f e and fn expfn defined as widely as possible we observe that n and n present no problems f and f to extend f to all positive real numbers it is clearly sufficient to define f on an interval of length such as and we want f to be continuously differentiable the paper only requires f to be continuously differentiable on or equivalently on this is obviously whacky but we neednt worry about this because ae next for no obvious or explained reason we require that f is monotone on the interval from the functional equation fx ln fx we get f x f x fx hence f f f f so f must be constant on not too surprisingly the function we get in this way is patched together from smaller pieces in a relatively unnatural way fx expxexpxx thus what i learned from the paper is that the correct solution to the problem probably has a minimum of its derivative between and,0

please consult the article name culture which states drag queen or transgendered wpor does not cover synthesis by bringing two facts together as well the term name queen does not have an article so the term is currently of dubious usage as its a neologism which wp policy suggests to avoid using you state a source tgmsmnet however neither this page nor the mainpage refer to such a reference from the way you talked about it i linked it to the mstsw reference in the future if you could could you please site resources on this page by using this form that way it shows up like this and one can simply click on the resource rather than search through the article for the reference itself your data is backed up there as well however we still have issue how would the cdc consider a postop mtf living in stealth as anything else but a female the mtf would obviously not admit to being a transsexual and in fact engages in no activity any more risky than a biological female i wait for further evidence that tgts is caused by biological factors and thus the term biological malefemale becomes complicated in even research no one would ever state that a woman with cais is biologically a male as well i understand the point of not using wp as a soap box however in talk pages im still free to assert the better application and appropriate nature of the term people having urap,0

replied talk please note that i did restore the revisions to talk rocker85 hi i couldnt help but notice that you have deleted several of my contributions that i worked very hard to create including several brand new pages that i had just made yes i know these pages were short and lacked content but you must know it takes time to write a long and informative page on wikipedia im just trying to contribute and i dont know why im having such a hard time doing it preceding unsigned comment added by talk contribs im not sure that edits such as this back up your claim of just trying to contribute and neither do the three articles which you created this afternoon which were as you know were just made up nonsense example if name was a christian this is what his philosophy would be called qed talk deletion hi you deleted i think these qualify under since they are the original language names for the article in question feitian space suit so are indeed likely search terms if someone read an article and copypasted or typed in the original name shouldnt they be able to reach the correct article you used csd reason r3 recently created redirects from implausible typos or misnomers however redirects from common misspellings or misnomers are generally useful as are redirects in other languages this says redirects in other languages are generally useful hi there this is a difficult one i can see both sides of the coin ive tried to see if there is a consensus by looking through categoryredirects from alternative languages but im still not sure i have always read the redirect from another language as being more related to things such as name topical one that one read the talk page but i digress or das wohltemperirte clavier rather than a literal transalation of every articles name in to other languages particulary those with nonlatin character sets this is why i feel that the two mandarin wordsphrases you have mentioned equally fall in to the territory of unlikelyimplausible phrases for a person to type on the english language wikipedia but the bottom line is that i am one admin one opinion which is a valid opinion but equally is far from unchallengable the redirects were speedily deleted so as there was no deletion discussion there is no community consensus for their deletion which means that you are free to recreate if they are renominated for deletion i will recuse myself from the process and well see what others think sound ok to you kind regards talk well theres the essay wikipediaredirects for discussionredirects from foreign languages the articles name is a phonetic and literal translation of the actual name ie its a chinese spacesuit the actual name is in chinese not english from the bit about nonlatin characters doesnt that indicate bias since english is used in hong kong as an official language where chinese characters are prevalent or india where nonlatin script is common and english is widely used but we already use a lot of implausible names that people would type,0

surtsicna has a very good point and i wholeheartedly new france was a colony colonies are not independent states and thus by definition dont have a head of state be it a president or a name name for example is not queen of the falkland islands because no such office exists and the falklands are not an independent state name is not president of french name because french name is a french overseas department and so on again colonies cannot have a head of state by definition canada after of course was not a colony legally had a monarchy separate from that of the uk and thus really should be the cutoff point names who ruled the country that was the colonial power that colonized canada is not the same thing as names of canadaincluding the french monarchs and the uk monarchs prior to makes as much sense as having a list of the british monarchs prior to on the page list of presidents of the united states,0

ok a direct quote from the page for fuck is other uses are dysphemistic the sexual connotation usually connected to masturbation in the case of go fuck yourself or go fuck your ass is invoked to incite additional disgust or express anger or outrage for example fuck that fuck no or fuck you thats a bit worse than saying masturbation is like taking a good dump mate come on just put it back up and quit being a douche,1
nope i didnt read the guide to appealing didnt have time the user in question is engaged in harassment ive been doing this long enough to know and i can prove it heshe immediately placed a threatening notice of blocking me permanently on my user page reverted the article while i was in the midst of editing it my second pass couldnt even preview changes then changed hisher mind as to my real wikisin since the onus for proving the doris day available as pd on archiveorg was on himher not me and the usual span for prebern had expired long ago decided my real sin was original research oh noes and continued to revert based on that does or add clutter sure it can but if the user in question was really concerned about that about the quality of the article and about extraneous details why didnt heshe even notice two paragraphs already there comprising about of the entire article dealt with name an unrelated book and an unrelated ice cream store name ill tell you why the user wasnt engaged in goodfaithgoodwill editing and the normal backandforth that leads to better articles heshe was involved in blocking input to the article why was it personal against me or was it to preserve the existing content of the article including the false claims and extraneous material not even concerned with ther subject at hand i can only speculate but id guess its some sort of power trip and wikibullying i dont really have time for this i have made a fair number of very good edits over the years and have usually refrained from saying anything that isnt directly related to content and improving articles i could pretend this user didnt do what heshe did but im wasting my own time here and i dont really have a stake in any such pretense i dont have any stake in improving this article either no dog in the race i just see how it can be improved and made more informative as a longterm wikipedia user and editor i dont see any problem in jumping in and fixing something i almost expect some sort of pushback now but not over completely minor edits which are very good and ontarget in very minor stublike articles the problem isnt me here its that if people such as the user in question can get away with this sort of behavior and they are getting away with it wikipedia becomes a much poorer place a playground filled with bullies rather than a library where we can all learn and share also i dont recal ever having called himher a bot i think you put those words in my mouth perhaps inadvertently hisher behavior is malicious but probably not malware just the normal human collection of problems i think this user should be warned against trying to be a gatekeeper heshe isnt quite qualified for that at this point anyway and its having a very chilling effect across wikipedia i wont egnage in a battle of the wikipedia rule acronyms i will continue to write in english and to read articles on wikipedia in english and to think of ways to improve them in english i am fully aware of how the terms vandlism are used and misused here and most of the rest of the wikijargon nothing new under the sun here if you read the edits i made carefully and note the times of the reverts and the history of actions by that other user you will see im not off the mark here at all i know whats going on i dont know why but i dont have to and i expect the motivations arent interesting name if you have anything to say,0

the discussion of when there first were outdoor trees with electric lights is very strange are you kidding and some obscure town in nc i dont think this makes much sense especially since the sentences immediately preceding these establish that other cities had electrically lighted outdoor christmas trees in the early years of the 20th century the article cited for the north carolina town if read carefully really only states that the tradition of having outdoor lighted trees in that specific town began in not that the town claims it was the first place to have such trees i am old enough to have been around in though i was a small boy and i can tell you that we and our neighbors in southern california had lighted outdoor trees prior to and no one thought it remarkable or unusual the history here is questionable to say the least,0

i agree like i aready have stated that this is peripheral to main article but nevertheless important because i merely underlienes the mythomania propagated by both sides my only interest here is historical reality name why dont you actually analyze the situation rather than offerring your usual smartalec remarks lontechs arguements have been shot to pieces summarily and everytime this happens he engages in tangential and irrational behaviour commonsense will tell you there was no longlasting state or kingdom in dardania before roman times we name just allow the intro paragraph to read like some kla recruiting website,0
i think we need to write to debretts name is now dead to ask if they actually had sight of the letters patent otherwise i would find it hard to accept their assertion it would effectively mean that his eldest daughter had a fundamental right to call herself and be referred to in all legal documents as baroness or name of berwick but in fact there is not one document notably her testament that i can find that refers to them as such merely as his daughters with the honorific name because they were daughters of an earl in addition debretts cannot settle these issues did name make a claim in the house for that peerage to be added to his stable because that seems to be what theyre saying frankly i would treat such a suggestion with disbelief,0
a tag has been placed on jordan bucher requesting that it be speedily deleted from wikipedia this has been done because the article seems to be about a person group of people band club company or web content but it does not indicate how or why the subject is notable that is why an article about that subject should be included in wikipedia under the criteria for speedy deletion articles that do not assert notability may be deleted at any time please see the guidelines for what is generally accepted as notable and if you can indicate why the subject of this article is notable you may contest the tagging to do this add on the top of the page below the existing db tag and leave a note on the articles talk page explaining your position please do not remove the speedy deletion tag yourself but dont hesitate to add information to the article that would confirm its subjects notability under the guidelines for guidelines on specific types of articles you may want to check out our criteria for biographies for web sites for bands or for companies feel free to leave a note on my talk page if you have any questions about this talk,0

you claim yet again that the text for example indiabased iyogi was reported by infoworld to use scare tactics and install undesirable software is not supported by the sources this is incorrect as both sources support both these assertions name a former washington post writer who now operates his own blog name on security tested iyogi himself and discovered that the company was indeed using scare tactics to coerce users into signing up then immediately went into my control panel and deleted what iyogi put on my computer and iyogi was using support calls to aggressively sell annual subscriptions proceeded to install an iyogi tune up tool called pcdiagnostics it took less than seconds to find this information in the sources provided and yes it is absolutely appropriate to include sourced information in wikipedia articles even if it happens to be negative for a certain company contributions talk,0

the vote was on the campbell case but the primary reason was the russian treaties name was careful to emphasise that the treaties were the substance of his objections name wrote to the king on october i saw mr name who in reply to my question do you want to turn the government out said yes but not on the campbell issue but on the russian treaties which the country generally condemns he sees no alternative to a dissolution it has always been expected some wished for it before now though he is opposed to hastening the governments fall and it is true that only in the house of commons were names strictures based on the campbell case at newcastle on october he congratulated name on the agreement achieved at a conference in london on the dawes plan for reparations and then spent the rest of the speech alternately pouring scorn on the labour partys subservience to its extremists and tearing to pieces the russian agreement but the final debate on october was a mean parliamentary occasion two days before in a meeting which was something of a suave qui puet the cabinet decided to take it as a vote of confidence preferring to go out on the campbell case to a defeat on the russian treaties which might give the left wing too much prominence middlemas and barnes p,0

well i am not goint to stay it simply to much of a waste of time maybe i will check back in in a few years and i would be happy to provide reading recommendations for anyone who asks me it would not be hard to find my real email address using the information about me you already know but i will take up this last discussion because of your specific invitation the name did not speak chinese they spoke their own language the official name of their land in their own language has been written about by ksenia kepping and is available on a link from the name language page in no case was name there autonym it was something like minyag which is waht they are called in tibetan in general i have a big chip on my sholder about sinologists becomming confucian literati the yuan and name were no more chinese than i am to use chinese names for these political entities is to take for granted the medieval chinese worldview while now it is indeed true that the prc owns a big chunk of asia how much of it is actually historically china the jurchens kitans name name tibetans nanchao azha t y h n were their own countries with their own languages and customs name history is relevant to chinese history in the way that french history is relevant to english history but also vice versa to have a thing on the article saying this article is part of the section chinese history reinforces the view that the names dont deserve their own history there is a sociological fact about western academia that sinology is big and well funded while nameology nanchaology kitanology etc are all virtually nonexistant but this is a fact about us and not about the history of centraleast asia,0

balance i find the balance of content in this article extremely unsatisfactory to introduce names career by saying he was an italian soldier politician and alleged war criminal for the use of poison gas and systematically bombarding and strafing red cross hospitals and ambulances during the ethiopia campaign due to postwar expediencies however he was never brought to justice seems to miss several points entirely thats words about his military and political career and about his activities as a war criminal the war criminal accusation is based entirely on one documentary source which is very short on facts and evidence if this war criminal accusation is true it needs to be strengthened with names dates and places and some evidence of names involvement in the events it seems to me far more important to stress the facts that name was one of italys most senior military figures during the second world war despite his doubts about italys strategic capabilities and that he became prime minister after the downfall of name names role in the inexplicable two months delay between july and september when italys future role in the war remained ambivalent while germany rushed troops south to fortify the italian peninsula is the most fascinating thing about his career whatever the reasons for his failure to act decisively names inaction condemned italy to suffer another twenty months of grinding war this article in its present form barely mentions those events,0

greek love im looking for a way to extricate myself honorably from this mess im leaving a note here because you closed this name where i made a commitment to do as you instructed in the closing statement there are two editors who have long sought to delete or eviscerate the article one of whom has used a series of user names unacknowledged on his current user page but available so at first glance it may appear on the talk page there are more than two editors in the suppress camp i complain here about their coordination other editors including and i simply cant do it any longer i havent changed my position on the validity of the article but ive been accused on various talk pages and never the appropriate notice boards of edit warring ownership disruption and even pedophilia by implication all for trying to carry out what the community decided im done i need to limit my time on wikipedia at present and wish for that time to be spent pleasantly and productively when ive made a commitment though it grieves me not to keep it im not asking you to do anything im just explaining why i cant keep my word as given at the name wow that is a messcertainly no hard feelings on my end it is clear you endeavored in good faith to improve the article i have found that knowing when to walk away is an essential skill not only here but in the real world sometimes your presence despite your best intentions is harmful rather than helpful and sometimes a dispute just isnt worth it anymore best of luck in your future endeavors here mailchimp im not that bothered but i think that the mailchimp speedy deletion was a mistake it did cite that it was one of the more important email marketing programs so it was stating the importance something that was supposed to be the original problem the criteria specifies a credible claim of significance wordpress pages are not reliable sources however i would certainly not object to it being restored as a redirect as it was for several momnths before today talkback talk just a hunch call it my intuition but im guessing that his username is a direct challenge to patrolling admin that you guys wont block him based on the username itself but his contribution speaks volume of his nonsense louder my other hunch being hes a returning editor than his username does just my cents cheers there are plenty of legitimate reasons to be a returning editor the username is not a blatant violation of the policy if you have any evidence of socking file at wpspi recreation of article name i would like to request that the article name be recreated see the deleted talkname for my reasons note talkname was delete because of name not notibility well there was,0

undent this was previously discussed quite a bit at this talk page see archive the consensus was that name is covered adequately in name presidential campaign name gets a couple paragraphs in that article the relationship if one can call it that between name and name was much more remote and brief than that between name and name many elections nowadays feature guiltbyassociation games but namenametucc is a bit different because the coverage went on so long during the campaign and the relationship went on so long in real life if name turns out to bedevil name as much as name and tucc has affected name it would merit inclusion here in this main name article there are hundreds of other items in the subarticles also picking out just name to add to this main article and not picking out those other hundreds of items would cause undue weight this article is about names whole life not just the current campaign and in the context of his whole life name is just not very significant if a person is scratching their head wondering the name of some minister connected with this election then the person can go to the article about names campaign which has a couple paragraphs about name in writing this article dozens of decisions were made about what the most important things in his life are and those that arent quite as important dont make the cut right now some of us think it would be more appropriate to add more about his vietnam service before the shootdown or more on namefeingold or more on his relations with the republican party in the early 2000s as compared to more about name,0

matia i have told you a hundred times that articles on dialects do not have the word language in the title witness brigish english mandarin linguistics flemish linguistics name cantonese linguistics american english name etc etc arvanitic is a dialect according to all our sources as interpreted by wikipedia policy therefore arvanitic language or name language are out of the question i dont want to use name albanian as it will be too controversial so i dont want albanian in the title therefore the only options are arvanitic or name they can and should be used arvanitic has the majority vote and therefore that shall be used what is wrong with it it is neutral it does not prescribe that arvanitic is a language or a dialect and as it has been pointed out the reader can review all the evidence for himselfherself and see what heshe thinks wikipedia should not take sides and especially wikipedia should not say that unesco name etc aree wrong name and luxembourgish etc can be treated as languages because all neutral credible sources say they are while the same sources say that arvanitic is a dialect if name or unesco etc said that they were dialects then they could be treated as such no neutral source formally aknowledges that they are dialects why should they be treated as such every neutral source says that arvanitic is a dialect and therefore should be treated as such and the word language should not be in the title we can discuss possibilities of it being a language in the text but not in the title arvanitic is neutral and will be used as it has received he majority support possibilities of arvanitic being a language in its own right can be discussed in the article not in the title as that would be a violation of wikipedias policies what unesco name etc say is assumed correct according to wpv and wpnor i am not labeling arvanites albanians against their will are we labeling the irish english against their will by calling their language hiberno english a dialect of english no so stop that straw man argument arvanitic is neutral and will not offend anyone and has majority support here and will be used according to policy the world is not made to please you neither is wikipedia we have policies that must be observed so if you want to use wikipedia you will just have to accept them regards ps does peace mean having to violate wp policies that is what you are asking me to do,0

nor have i made a legal threat first i am not among those three people who participated in that visit to the blm protest i have never known any of these people i would not be the offended party in any case ive never even lived in minnesota or been there in over years or so i made an airplane connection through minneapolis in about as i vaguely recall i am not saying there will be any sort of legal proceeding i am merely saying that to cite this claim heard the nword risks running afoul of being libel i think wp rules allow us to express concern that the cite of a vague assertion that somebody heard the nword is problematic from a wpblp standpoint if multiple blm protestors claim that they heard one of the white visitors say the nword and it was cited from some reliable source that would probably change my opinion can you see why this would be a different situation,0

please do not accuse members of vandalism i do not mind if you change the word unique to prominent or remove stories of dreams etc but you have vandalised the page and made a statement biased by saying that dr name only sent out a referendum so i reverted the whole edit you have also reciently vandalised the page by removing the names of the yemeni scholars who recieved dr names ijaza including the pictures and this is a clear form of vandalism so before accusing other members of vandalism do not vandalise the page yourself what i did was clearly not vandalism as i only reverted your edit and any changes you made and brought the page back to its previous form so would you first kindly read the rules of wikipedia and find out the definition of vandalism before accusing experienced users you are still new to wikipedia im afraid and you need to learn how it works and the different rules of wikipedia before making any further edits,0

bakan why is name even mentioned in this article based on the worthless rag of hers which is cited as a source in this article shes nothing but a shill for name and the rest of the commie gang in that rag she not only shows egregious procommunist bias but doesnt even bother to check the facts much less look at the causes of the kronstadt rebellion or even cite reliable historical sources on that subject she also discredits herself with absurd accusations of a white conspiracy to overthrow the soviet government and even of the rebellion being motivated by antisemitic racism among the sailors furthermore all the claims made in that rag are based on a case of begging the question that is since names communist regime was good major premise and the kronstadt rebellion harmed said regime minor premise suppressing the rebellion was justified last but not least the mere fact that the aforementioned rag was first published by a selfadmitted socialist party by definition means that this source does not meet either wpnpov or wprs if such sources continue to be used in wikipedia articles the whole project will soon turn into commiepedia,0

czech republic is in central europe the state of this article is part of the reason why people are making such confusions especially more ridiculous is that they you would replace the mention of north caucasus in favor of north slope of name which isnt even a geographical area other than denoting the mountains in that region countries are located within continents yet for some reason you refuse to allow this article to be denoted a continent this single factor alone would have made a massive difference for readers im tired of arguing with people who are essentially wikisquatters refusing to nudge on a given article,0

i agree with leontes though i began attempting compromise last night considering no one else was backing me up on this in the interest of building consensus however i will note that political descriptors in the absence of reliable third party sources are inappropriate in this article i will also note again that some commenters here appear to be confusing the electoralvote website with the electoralvote author this wikipedia article is about the website not the author who has an article of his own,0
okay i have now tried to just delete the offensive sentences in the beginning about mr name being a socalled holocaust denier he says himself he is not and acknowledges that many jews were killed during the war however he does not go along with the million jews killedfigure as he reckons the number to be lower and it really comes down to that name has the right to question anything relating to history and ww2 is his speciality and he actually makes a living of questioning and critically examining sources i also decided to delete the account about him loosing a court case in name have launched several libel cases before in he won libeldamage against an english sunday newspaper the fact that he this time lost is not something that should figure at the head of his cv many people also find it extraordinary that a judge can deside what a person is or is not and what beliefs he holds,0

randroide answers to next step guys i do not see you taking steps to wikipediarequests for mediation i can not do this job because i always connect from filtered institutional netaccess and following those steps could result in new undesired controversial truncation of words by the software i do not want that happenning could you please follow the instructions in the link i provided thank you randroide answers to new reference by burgas00 at last we agree on somethingof course that the new section is a good idea the false suicidal terrorists from prisa will also be included there come oooooon boys start writing that section i do not want all the kudos for myself the new proposed article is by now an effort made only by me but remember npov and sources all the sources just like me citing el pa s in the section about the doubts about the genuineness of the 13th bomb cheers indeed a good point and all the remarks in cope too and the moral certitudes of mariano rajoy published in el mundo i agree with you larean what randroide omits to mention on the section about the 13th bomb is that he only added balancing references when i insisted that he do so the original version he created was entirely pov as is much of the rest of the proposed article also all the sources that he added from el pais are only available to subscribers npov it is not you are right southofwatford in your randroide omits section if you have not subscription to el pa s i am sorry but that s your problem my institutional access also has some advantages like paid access to el pa s and many many other publications and books that s one of the reasons for my exclusive use of filtered internet accesss it s much easier for me to work here due to the easy availability of sources do you see the truncation of words is offsett i think by better sources btw if you write under a randroide answers section you are invading my space i do not mind really but you are doing it risking new truncations on your messages to avoid this please write outside randroide answers sections if you think that the proposed article is pov work in it to make it npov the article is not mine ill take the risk of you truncating the reply and put it here its very short the issue is not whether i subscribe to el pa s its whether the people who read an article in the english wikipedia subscribe to it all sources used should be accessible to all readers of the article putting in a source that readers will not be able to see just so you can claim the article is npov is to my mind completely unreasonable all sources used should be accessible to all readers of the article very funny southofwatford i am going to follow this joke of yours please propose also the deletion of all books as sources because did you know there is always someone without this or that book delete all references to tv or radio stations because that user in brazil has no tv and no radio at home delete all the references in spanish because did you know there are users who know no spanish it s a pleasure to read this kind of funny jokes really i had a good laugh usersouthofwatford how strange that you should find it so funny after all most of the sources we are providing should enable users to find out more information about what is being sourced so to deliberately choose sources that require those users to pay to see the information is not funny its simply bizarre equally in the english wikipedia i would argue that choosing a spanish or other foreign language source when an equally valid source exists in english does not make sense except perhaps to those who are too busy laughing your cynicism is evident in your response,0

i am not sure if you are really understanding what i have been saying we cannot put our own views or views of a leader of any party or even base the partys ideology on them i have been requesting you to read their manifestos from the very beginning any party will not run on a single leaders views or any newspaper views if you find the cpnm and cpnuml identically same or if you find one partys inclination towards socialism andor hardliner communism in simple words their political ideology and ultimately their position on the spectrum same as the other in their manifestos please let us all know i will immediately withdraw my points let us not debate here any single person who has read both manifestos would be crystal clear on the ucpnm and cpnuml as far as what their position is do not trust me but at least please go through their manifestos also i have been watching many parties wiki pages of several countries across continents and all of them have their position stated why do you want to not keep it here ithink it makes it more clear with their position on the spectrum thanks,0

way i see it people who say the name is a very good tank are seriously overestimating it i mean come on it was nicknamed name for a reason you know any tank that has to maneuvre around at close range to the sides and rear of an opposing tank to score a kill is definitely not good the only notable good name at the end of the war is the vc firefly but because us ordinance doubted the pounder could be fitted onto the tank it was manufactured in limited quantities the only notable features of the name was that it was produced in large quantities had a mechanical reliability that beat the t and came with better secondary equipment such as fm radio and an elevation gyrostabiliser not to mention the extremely sad stories behind it once a name maneuvered around a building to hide from a tiger tank the tiger shot at the building and the shell went right through and penetrated the names turret there are also tales of german tanks who take out two aligned names in one shot also do you know why you see all these wartime photos of crewmen who have names with spare road wheels and tracks welded onto the hull those are efforts to help augment the armour of the name,0

obviously there is some antiamericanism in canada this means nothing necessarily with regards to the structure of this article i was referring to the specific idea that canadian students fear their sovereignty will be overwhelmed or that canadians consider themselves cultural correctives to americans and i asked for another side of the story and questioned how big of a deal this was to put in the introduction your response here is confusing as far as citing my sources i am questioning your views and whether they belong in the article not making additions to the article several of your quotes are very weak examples many countries could claim antiamericanism on the basis of involvement in the middleeast that doesnt mean its a relevant enough addition to put into the introduction of an article on one of the most trafficked websites in the world that is meant to specifically talk about the major issues between two specific countries as far as your sources go you did not comment on the obscurity of them you have still not properly defended name yes that was me who removed that a year ago i dont see why you get to just dub a source reliable when i thoroughly explained why i determined it unreliable or rather inappropriate to add i read that source left you detailed comments and you said something like dont pov push and reverted my edits you are not making an argument here re culture clash in archive again there are two sides to every story please try to tell both if you are going to edit this article many canadians would laugh at the idea that the usa causes a profound fear that their sovereignty will be overwhelmed and why do students opinions have so much weight by the way but there likely wont be many sources to support this because the initial premise that it even might be the case is so rare that such sources wouldnt exist for a counter argument nevertheless ill take a look one last time this is about obscurity clouding neutrality and onesideness breaching neutrality i am not trying to say that what youre saying is not true at all im sure it is true the the extent that it is but how much is that the points in question fall so far below the relevance required to be in the introduction to an article that they should be immediately moved,0

well i see futperf is getting quite angry now insulting other editors also and again their goal is make the point that the first bulgarian empire and the second bulgarian empire are not bulgarian or at least not related which helps their long term strategy for the invention of a macedonian nation and state think name etc which existed from antiquity and the middle ages thats it tropcho correctly pointed out that direct political continuity is completely unimportant for the info box no other country cares for this in their info box neither spain germany ireland poland etc what is important is to show how bulgaria formed thru the ages,0

all of those statements need to be referenced leaving an article unreferenced in every section opens the door for original research and the introduction for factually inaccurate information to point out one thing ill bring up consolidated appropriations act first it has a number of tags on it the creation of articles that need to be tagged should be reason number to remove the flag second the only referencelink provided on the article is this one while the information is from various subpages of that it appears that the entirety of the article is found at this deeper link its possible that some came from this as well i cant tell ill also note that the style of the summary it was taken from was never meant to be encyclopedic so the article is riddled with grammatical errors mostly incomplete sentences on creation the opening read consolidated appropriations act hr is a bill passed to the 112th united states congress ive never heard this usage to rather than by and assume it is incorrect another editor changed it the lead is also missing an important determiner in any case you can take a look at vesey,0

homosexuals are intent on legitimizing their behavior therefore they will seize any opportunity to suggest that famous persons are gay in this way their way of life will be received as being not only harmless but perfectly normal as generations of people grow from childhood to maturity and are exposed to this strategy they increasingly develop a tolerance for homosexuality in this way it is now almost universally accepted as a diverse or alternate behavior or way of being similar to a religion race or nationality name,0
or between the french and the wnameloons surprise our article on french people clearly labels the wnameloon as a distinct ethnic group perhaps it is best not to make comparisons after screwing it up a few times i have done rewrites of parts of the article mainly a word and a sentence left and right to make the distinction and relation between the dutch and the flemish clearer the article switched constantly between parts about the dutch only and parts about the dutch and flemish together this should now be clearer the major thing left to adjust are the graphs of the number of dutch since these still name include the flemish,0

i mean really they are a new editor that appeared to be editing on good faith adding information that was included in an already used source their edit summary didnt show any hostility so you should not retaliate with any odds are they havent even looked at their talk page so your comment wont be read anyways if the act of reverting dubious additions from new users is stressing you out maybe this is a problem you should see about solving instead of acting like it is a personal attack on you plus name already warned them on their talkpage and they have not added anything since showing that maybe they have listened to the advice your threat was completely unnecessary maybe explaining to them that the information has already been added but rejected and why would be a better option wpagf and wpbite are very important like i said in the dispute resolution page i dont mean to make any enemies i think you are an amazing editor that does a lot for the project on many aspects although your attitude when people do things against your wishes needs to be worked on if you wish to avoid further complications talk edits,0

mediation hello i am name and i have volunteered to take on your mediation case during this discussion i will remain neutral with both sides of this argument and will endeavor to solve your dispute after having a look at the discussion above this is what i have found quizzicalbee has been adding the sentence according to name the the us embassy repeatedly refused to help her leave the country as they no longer recognized her as a us citizen hurmata has been reverting this back to she reports that the us embassy repeatedly refused to help her leave the country hurmata objects to quizzicalbees sentence as heshe thinks that the source is incorrect as the guards would have allowed name into the embassy and first hand accounts from name herself does not qualify as a reliable source qb objects saying that maybe in the 1960s us citizenship could have been revoked by the usafgan government at that time and perhaps in the past the guards may have denied entry and that her claim should have been presumed true until proven false hurmata countered that the citation threat qb was referring to is not the one that was cited qb states that there is no evidence disproving her claims so they are valid could the involved users please place below to verify that this statement is correct or suggest why it is not correct thankyou talk,0

damage controversy unfortunately i am unable to get a source for the damage issue and so it keeps getting deleted it did happen i remember it well does anyone have any reference from a newspaper or magazine at the time as i am unable to find a websource there was a big hoo haha over it at the time in smash hits debated whether or not to put the boyband damage on the front cover of an issue of their publication they felt that as the band were black this may mean that they would suffer a loss of sales for that issue it was mistakenly thought that smash hits had never previously had a band with an all black line up on the cover when in fact the likes of sade name and five star had featured on the front page,0
an admittedly biased source but with more or less first hand information is the chabad group which just smuggled or at least claims to have matzoh from the ukraine to iran for the name holiday the news article states that members of the chabad organization smuggled a huge quantity of matzot into iran last week in order to enable local jews in the islamic republic to celebrate the name according to tradition some jews currently live in iran the authorities allow them freedom to practice their religion but forbid the import of israelmade products to the country an act that could cost a person three years imprisonment or the revoking of his passport for five years while they probably didnt get an exact census of the people they were delivering to id guess that they at least got the number reasonably correct so seems to be the way to go,0

can there be a more concise listing the listing of other inventions is profoundly vague why group different categories together why even mention things that the chinese received purely from outside sources there should be a much more complete well managed list of chinese developments which ive yet to find along with how these were transmitted globally and whether or not places like europe got them purely from the chinese this really needs the attention of people with some remote expertise which i guess is somewhat there when names work which is profoundly rare in private collections was cited not like the arrogant bigoted ass who was crying about chinese nationalism yet then went onto say that they only invented noodles and besides why are things like the cannon and porcelain listed under other inventions who developed these independently,0

four years after writing my vision is that wikipedia should not say e is a fool when all it can really say is that d has called e a fool lima has taken the opposite opinion in the same article the preferred edit is that church teaching places the origin of the eucharist in last supper and cites the catholic catechism and name and an anglican bishop reading the footnotes one discovers the cited passages to not support that thesis and instead of reproducing quotes faithfully or arguing for some exception to a policy which requires verifiability the article is rerverted to the point of view of the editors without even selective quotation on the positive side im learning a lot about eucharistnot from this wikipedia article i have to say as much as running down footnotes i never knew the eucharist was announced before the last supper until i read in the catholic catechism that tidbit doesnt appear in any wikipedia article i read the last supper is the institution of the eucharist to catholic not the origin according to the catholic catechism cited here from yet you couldnt tell it from our little article,0

another crap article parrots what promotion websites of capoeira schools say about myths of origin and also that persecution thing by the late 1800s capoeira became a word for street brawling thus authorities did not prohibit or sanction practice of capoeira in banning capoeira they were banning outright street brawls its why name presented his art as name no decent carioca would be eager to sympathise with capoeira and malandrismo i could attempt to alter the article but its become such a mess by now,1

first i just realized via your question that i could answer here assuming it saves yes i finally get that my attacks were totally inappropriate and unneccessary i confess i did not at first even this morning i realize i made inappropriate attacks after looking at his contributions and assuming some highly speculative personal motivation and then asking him about it in an offensive way i would not be at all surprised if others have made negative assumptions about me based on looking at my contributions history and attacked me so the user does have my sincere sympathies and apologies what to do differently when groups go after me write a better wikiquette name several people go to wpani naming several people do userrfcs naming several people that is where i admit i need further advice since a year old off wiki email is often the focus of harassment and so far the advice is not to go into detail about it i dont know how to defend the recurrent references to it let me say again it was a stupid overly generalized and exaggerated response but certainly not written with some evil bigoted intent i feel that a lengthy correction of it complete with refs about then existing specific incidentsissuesetc or stating in detail my current views would be inappropriate even on my user page and doubtless lead to more accusations by people who have a different pov but if theres some policy on this that i missed i sure wish people would help me out with that,0

israelipalestinian conflict protect yesterday there were relevent and reliablysourced casualty figures added to the israelipalestinian conflict article and some editors objected to this it seems you were called in to quickly protect the page from editing effectively blocking the inclusion of the figures you cited edit warring the more accurate term would be repeated reverts from those who did not like the figures for political reasons there are casualty figures in all the conflict war battle etc name articles i have referenced why not this one thanks romac the edits which you tried to make were a set of statistics for one year only which you attemepted to place in the first paragraph of an article describing a conflict of over sixty years this article covers an issue of extreme sensitivity and complexity the fact that your edits sparked so much conflict and opposition speaks for itself here at namepedia we value the ability to achieve consensus and to be fair to many viewpoints and believe it or not we often do achieve that at the article israelipalestinian conflict it is not enough to disinegnuously claim that your figures were reliable without addressing any of the underlying issues or any of the conflicts which it clearly and immediately caused to repeat statistics for just one year of the conflict do not belong anywhere in the articles lead there are a wide variety of figures which either side could quote all in the name of objectivity which would clear and unacceptably attempt to create a slant towards one side or the other please note this is why we are careful when making edit to be sure that we actually have consensus rather than simply telling others that they should provide consensus i strongly object to your calling me disinegnuous sic you wrote on the article talk page that you agreed with hertz1888 who argued that the statistics might be biased do you not regard haaretz as a reliable source please explain more clearly why you feel that citing reliablysourced and uptodate civilian casualty statistics in an article about a war battle or conflict is disingenuous if you or any other editor want to add more statistics covering a longer time period then go ahead but do not delete relevant content added by other editors yes the edit sparked so much conflict and opposition but note also also that here at namepedia we do not determine what is fair through intimidation by numbers there is a big difference between consensus and false compromise i apologize if you felt i was offending you in any way i only meant to describe the appearance of your edits not to describe you personally in any way if other editors deleted some edits it is because they genuinely felt there was a reason to do so and that the material was not beneficial or fair to the article i responded to your concerns and issues further at the article talk page thanks apology accepted and i will also make my further comments on the article talk page i am not a singleissue editor i get around a bit on name saw the haaretz report and very much believe it is something very relevant to the article i cant say i know for certain why other editors deleted the material i try to assume good faith well see repeated reverts from those who did not like the figures for political reasons motive doesnt really matter its still edit warring its still disruptive protection is not an endorsement of the current version zman the subject of this article is a deadly conflict the lede is huge and yet it contains no mention of the casualties clearly there is something seriously wrong as a result your action here while wellintentioned looks highly partisan worse than that it looks rather like like a cynical move to protect deniers those who wish to cover up atrocities the mass killings of mostly unarmed civilians in many cases recognised by western sources as warcrimes if the events at this article really offend you it would be a lot better to lock it at the alternative version talk,0

why commonwealth instead of dominion based upon comparing the governments of the dominion of canada and the commonwealth of australia i dont really understand the differences the idea of a commonwealth seems to compare directly with that of a republic so if the queen of great britain and northern ireland is the queen of australia how can one style australia a commonwealth would it not be a dominion as is the case for canada and would not the states of australia likewise be provinces i honestly dont understand the differences between each of these and if someone could explain them to me it would be greatly appreciated july utc,0

of course only you may decide isnt that right name name,0
you know what forget it the guy who was repeatedly changing the opening and led me to post what was previously here because he repeatedly refused to answer the simple question of why except of course to start shouting has reported me for not being civil how ironic is that rather than have a long detailed discussion here about which opening is better ill simply point out that in the current version even after you read the entire first paragraph you still dont have a clue why this article exists you do find out what name does for a living though so yay for that i guess once you get to the end you do get some idea why this has been such a big deal but thats assuming you havent fallen asleep or shot yourself having read the same four words brazil germany biggest loss and their million variants multiple times seriously if people here think whats currently serving as an opening to this article summarises the key points in an engaging and professional way perhaps you need to get a job where your actually paid to write for a living its not quite garbage but its not good and please stop justifying such poordullrepetitivetrivial writing with the claim the alternatives are unencyclopedic frankly you couldnt be more wrong theres no serious disagreement out in the world that this defeat was a shock result and a national humiliation that will be upfront in the key summary of every decent source writing about this match both now and in years time if you dont want it to be in this one please think of a better reason than unencyclopedic if only that the victims might have a clue what it is you actually mean that said on the offchance anyone with any ability for writing gets around to working on this article heres what the opening should look like if youre trying to engage the reader while summarizing the key points its not perfect but its a hell of a lot better than the crap people fought tooth and nail to replace it with brazil germany was the shock result of the first semifinal of the fifa world cup mens international football tournament played on july at the est dio mineir o in belo horizonte brazil it broke brazils match home unbeaten streak in competitive matches going back to and equalled their biggest margin of defeat tied with a loss to uruguay in leading it to be described as a national humiliation the game also saw germany score the most goals in world cup history their overtaking brazils their second goal meant germanys name reached world cup goals overtaking brazils name as the tournaments alltime record goalscorer the game was subsequently referred to by the press as the mineirazo evoking the spirit of the maracanazo in which brazil unexpectedly lost the fifa world cup on home soil to uruguay,0

name your motives are clearly not about being more encyclopaedic as we have seen your methods time and time again as the wikipedia page says you can quickly insert inline references to web pages by inserting a url surrounded by single square brackets this does not provide as much information to readers but it is much better than not citing your sources at all interestingly i see you have only attacked and vandalized the quotes website and none of the watchtowers multiple links no surprise there with your gross bias screaming from the rooftops as for the links to quotes websites they are extremely encyclopaedic and the page has no commentary but lists all the printed material about so as to give fair and reasonable coverage rather than just a few selective quotes they are all given their source publication date and page numbers for proof and reference your apparent fear and terror that the public might actually read what the watchtower organization has written is very revealing you clearly have an agenda to vandalize and ban free speech when it doesnt suit your agenda not dissimilar to your religious organisation i suggest you look inside and see why now after many months you feel the desperate need to hide accurate comprehensive dated quotes direct and unaltered that have been published by the watch tower society if you can give all the publications from the watchtowers website then im sure many here will be only to happy to list that link but i think you will find they refuse to give any information to the public about their less than flattering publications and that is where we all need to see a comprehensive and fully documented source like the excellent quotes site on you have failed to substantiate any of your claims about the quotes site merely saying its not useful is a deadpan pov with no basis but your own fear of reality and your desperate urged to manipulate the public posted central august,0

name the explaination above that since the article of the war is called lebanon war and since that war only since has been called the first lebanon war only in and to israel then this war should be called lebanon war is incorrect and that logic is not supported by wikipedia policy the lebanon has very little credentials as i am proving above israelhezbollah war carries no pov implications the excuse namename named above is purely original and cannot be heard anywhere else in all seriousness using his logic lebanon war would be incorrect since fighting began and took place in israel as well israelhezbollah war meets the criteria of rule and neither namename nor any other editor has come close to proving another single name and namename c it doesnt list the party that suffered the most death and destruction as a result of the conflict way to make up wikipedia policy i do not appreciate that at at all you know as an editor that that is purely and totally irrelevant i agree that lebanon war isnt perfect but it is the closest to meeting wikipedia policy we have found thus far also the c it doesnt list the party that suffered the most death and destruction as a result of the conflict is entirely relevant to wikipedia policy per naming conventions rule it becomes quickly apparent to anyone doing even the minimum amount of research that israelhezbollah war doesnt meet rules or it might meet rule though that is also disputable talk,0
free software open source in many articles you show your intention to use the phrase free and open source the best way to deal with this is to choose the term used by the developers of the programs in question themselves if you are working on a page about a program where the developers explicitly use that term i have no objection if the developers use free software it is best to use exactly that for that specific program if the developers of a certain program use only open source and the license of the program is indeed an open source license excluding the gnu gpl its text explicitly uses the term free software then its ok to use that description the purpose is that the reader should not understand the word free to mean gratis in this case unfortunately just using free alone makes it more likely that people will understand gratis if you software into that phrase free and open source something like open source and free software it would be better,0

ive been working for some time on categoryroman bridges but you certainly provide new infos here this is what a webpage says about the alconetar bridge destroyed in the 13th century arches left moved in i hope they did not change the arch structure then here the most authoritative photo el puente de alcon tar sobre el tajo en garrovillas c ceres name estaba en la v a de la plata name tambi n monumental fue destruido por los rabes en el siglo xiii y nunca despu s reconstruido hoy d a es un puente sin r o name hubiera name por name en el a o se trasladaron sus restos a un nuevo emplazamiento apenas quedan tres arcos de los que tuvo se aprecia su solidez en sus fuertes machones as for the pons fabricius there are some roman bridges and even more medieval ones whose arches are designed somewhere between semicircular and segmental this is only natural as a demanding structure the segmental arch bridge could not have been invented in a day but must have been reasonably the result of a lengthy development process this means there are certainly transitory forms between the two types what we need in every single case is the spanrise ratio of the bridge to make qualified judgements on its segmental or semicircle character,0
i just read something interesting apparently there have never been a minority living in this village this village was always populated with only bulgarians not albanians or any other also when the mosque was build in razgrad there was material taken from this village the sultan of the ottoman empire issued a ferman declaring that no turkish muslim builder working on the mosque will spend the night there so it is impossible for his to be albanian because there were never albanians in this village i found this in wikipedia,0

negatively biased article the following was entered into the article text in these edits by whomever wrote this wikipedia information has a clear bias and is absolutely against dr name in this biograpgy he is promptly attacked as a fraud before and after stating the life of dr name the refrences of public magazines where dr name is pointed as a fraud are commentary opinionated and are not mere fact it is clear that dr names life is quite controversial and to discredit him is the easiet form to invalidate his claims out of evident knowledge dr name was not anticatholic he only spoke what he lived it would be quite contradicting to have been not only a roman catholic but a jesuite and then be margined as anticatholic obviously this would be the best label in order for catholics to reject and discard whatever dr name has said,0

ive come across variations on draughts as ive always called it we had a compendium of games that came in a cube it had six sides on it one of which was a checkered board for playing chess and draughts on with draughts apart from the traditional version there were the following variations dammspiel thats what the manual called it i think its also called damenspiel you set them up a bit like chess but they were placed one square forward hard to explain the pieces moved almost identical to regular draughts diagonally one square i think the kings could move multiple squares a bit like the flying kings rule people have mentioned except that you stop short of capturing my memory is hazy on the issue turkish checkers similar settup to dammspieldamenspiel it looks a bit like chess with draughts pieces the setup being on the same squares youd use for draughts pieces move one square forwards and if i remember rigtly capture diagonally like standard draughts the kings i believe move like rooks in chess and jump only once in a straight line again my memory is hazy regarding the rules one game not listed in the manual was a game known by one of three names name name or kings played similar to standard draughts you play it cornertocorner and set the pieces up as kings in the shape of an arrow or dagger you then play it like regular draughts i have played draughts with at least three opponents a relative somebody at school and somebody i once shared a house with and they were convinced that a single man cant take a king apparently according to this page thats the rules in italian draughts,0

not happy i am not happy with the tone of this comment you seem to be confused firstly are you seriously saying that as product manager visualeditor team you are completely unable to give a useful answer to a question about what the plans for mathematics rendering are or what progress has been made against those plans does mathematics rendering really have nothing whatsoever to do with visual editor or is there some other reason why you prefer not to answer the question secondly if you wanted to be helpful instead of airily alluding to the volunteers who maintain that extension you might have said who they are who are the people to whom in your opinion i should address that question please thirdly if you really wanted to be helpful and i am finding it hard to avoid the conclusion that you do not you might even have volunteered to pass the question on to the approriate people rather than batting it back so unhelpfully once again if you engage constructively with the volunteer mathematics editor community it is likely to prove of benefit to the project so far im seeing less of a serious attempt to engage and too much petty pointscoring,0

restoring to the original version the article has been restored to its original bclass version before the edits by by78 the pib article on which by78 made the edit is incorrect that report was submitted by the army from the article the standing comitteed to which the report was submitted says there were clear factual inaccuracies in the armys deposition before the standing committee the most glaring of them is the armys suggestion that it is carrying out trials on the names performance in fact the army has already accepted the name for introduction into service based upon its driving and firing performance over the years after firing trials in summer the trial report written by the army said the accuracy and consistency of the name has been proved beyond doubt the ongoing trials in pokhran that the army is citing are accelerated usage cum reliability trials aucrt in these two name tanks were run almost nonstop for kilometres not to judge performance but to evaluate the tanks requirement of spare parts fuel and lubricants during its entire service life i would like by78 to prove that indeed the problems mentioned in the article is that mentioned in the pib article from latest sources after the parliamentary committee agreeing about the pib report being wrong also i request admins not to revert back until by78 proves the above requested things his edit will become unverifiable and based on the pib report which is incorrect thank you all,0

controversy your point here is well taken but for the fact a person can be well aware of possible distinctions in terminology and still call a magazine a clip in actuality it is the firearm experts that insist on a controversy by way of insisting on their terminology in other words because they have taken issue with the laymans wording they have indeed made it controversial and not the other way around so while the distinction in wording may not be controversial within their circle of buddies they are in fact responsible for the controversy mw dictionary when i say the dictionary clearly im referring to the dictionary i cited before in this case mw i am a cognitive miser like anyone that takes short cuts when i can just as you shortened it to mw rather than grasp at straws in dissecting ones arguments let us focus on the big picture when we know what each other means i agree the dictionary isnt for giving an exhaustive description thats what encyclopedias are for however in this instance it does shed some light on the controversy as it does indeed define a clip as also a magazine the reason for including it is not to give people a better understanding of the differences between types of clips or the different types of magazines the purpose of including it is to show the other side of the controversy and according to my research within wikipedia this is entirely acceptable agreement clearly some people dont agree with mw just as you and i dont agree with saamis statement that people sometimes refer to cartridge clips as magazines the experts on weapons have this fact somewhat backwards and are incorrect as they should state that people refer to magazines as clips just because you and i disagree with saamis statement doesnt mean it should be taken out as a reference and id never suggest that what i suggest is a compromise i agree with you about the references regarding remington and marlin as that does seem to fall under or mw however doesnt fall under or as it is a published source and being a leader in its industry it could be argued is the authority on word use do you have any suggestions on how it could be incorporated so as to show how this controversy is perpetuated without saying its wrong because it clearly isnt according to common usage im thinking something like thisname technically defineduse to describe magazine is controversialhowever mw defines it as such this allows readers to see their is a difference in terms there is a controversy and why it potentially exists or is perpetuated i think this is fair note well that i never attempted to remove any sources that backed up what youre saying here im not interested in destroying your view only presenting both sides fairly,0

in point of fact the plot summary unaccountably omits the key revelation that implicates name as the real mole and mastermind behind the murders of names team ie names discovery after his argument with krieger in the london hotel that the bible he has been consulting to communicate with name was originally from the drake hotel in chicago this points the finger at name being in the prague safe house prior to his purportedly first meeting with the team to discuss the mission and where he incidentally mentions his stay at the drake the crucial relevance of this is made obvious at the time of its discovery and is later confirmed during the showdown in the baggage department when name asks name when he knew and then remarks damn gideons,0

quoting from the article rubbish was thrown at her and the crowds jeered in part because she dressed in expensive clothing which served to alienate her from those suffering the privations caused by the war and windsor castle about miles kilometres west of central london so the views that you express are already represented in the article it seems fair and wellbalanced to me making it critical is not what wikipedia is about we should not be a platform for political views but an encyclopedia presenting facts,0

i must quote what dominus wrote some time ago on my talk page when i translate i use province of lower silesia etc however here on wikipedia i have to go with decisions made long ago the problem is that wikipedia is increasingly used for reference by people who are not translators they should be aware that in real life the use of voivodeship results in confusion as foreigners usually have no idea what this word means some polish people may not care about it because polish is a readerresponsible language so polish authors do not need to write understandably because readers are responsible for understanding by contrast english is a writerresponsible language ie writers in english are responsible for making their texts understandable i wrote about the classification and some other problems related to translation in my article pages importantly this is reflected in the wikipedia manual of style as one of the five general principles of wikipedia is clarity writing should be clear and concise plain english works best avoid jargon and vague or unnecessarily complex wording voivodeship is jargon understandable nearly exclusively to polish people i started a similar discussion in wikipedia many years ago but i was quickly defeated by people saying that a consensus has been reached and now its too late i wish i was more experienced then and knew that voivodeship is against the principles of wikipedia,0

the appearance seems to depend both on the browser and the window size and ive been fiddling with the image placement to try to balance them i dont like the block quote template as it doesnt seem to do anything and i prefer quotes of this sort to stand out typographically in some way the quote in this case seems to have a dickensian sound to it which provides a sense of the period im hoping that the readership will like it but critics abound alas anyway thanks for your input,0

i repeat the text was about a minority school these schools were the same for every minority not about the treatment of germans in the public secondly the weak identity thing is a nice lie because then you have to explain why the names did not have weak identity in romania or in serbia and now there are more of them in those countries than in hungary although the opposite was the case after the population exchange i will answer you because their schools were shut down in the 1960s thirdly you somehow forget that whether the minorities not only name have a weak identity or not the hungarian government unlike the governements of all its neighbouring countries has abolished schools with the respective languages as languages of instruction you can play with words but that is a fact bilingual schools even if they would work which they did not are not enough and above all there was absolutely no reason for such a deterioration other then finishing the magyarisation and this aim was successfully achieved or are you implying that since the minorities had such weak identity the government decided to help them by cancelling education in their mother language do you actually read what you write,0

cybershore after carefully looking over your additions to the article even with my changes to your grammer i see that they are redundant and add nothing while making some things less clear i oppose their addition what additions specifically youre talking about so i can adjust or respond why again this double standard behavior related just to one part since i answered all the objections one by one while the seriously and gravely accusation made up by me and proved repeatedly throughout this year and a half about spurious quote remains ignored and please answer this time is the spurioness justifiable under any circunstances in the case of an encyclopedia that is intended to be free and neutral which group of honest editors would admit the use of partial referrals that lead to political and historical inferences in favor of a political regime monarchical military etc whatever be worse which group of honest editors would allow the use of spurious citations of a partial source for purposes mentioned above even if this purposes are involuntary although the time that passed without actions having been taken as well as the resistance to remediation maintained only makes this possibility of involuntariness unlikely which group of honest editors who were truly committed to the freedom and neutrality of such instrument would vote against such remediation or would omit about it,0

as far as presenting sources are concerned the book the life and exploits of name the great sites much more sources in detail than source which i think refers to some sources already referred by others as such it is as credible as its own sources and not whether the author is researcher of repute and printed by reputed publisher its credibility therefore lies in sources which are presented sparsely in the book perhaps perhaps not as far as the author is concerned in my understanding he himself suggested that the story of name that originated from egypt should be considered more authentic than others reasons given as it is hardly likely that their writers and scribes would hasten to record his history whereby they would also incidentally describe their own national defeat to these countries then we must not look for the original name story similarly we must not look to the states of greece for it because at the death of name the memory of their subjugation and the victorious deeds which he wrought for the glory of macedon would be too fresh in the minds of their peoples one country only could be the birthplace of the name story and that country was egypt i am not sure if the general discussion is driven by this very idea ie keeping the name story from egypt as authentic which the scholarship of the author has indeed explained so well along with origin of other sources especially ones from greece that perhaps dominate current understanding this according to me forms one of the essence of the name story and i hope someone clarifies which story is the egypt story in the said book which i myself is unsure for i dont have that experience and skill to tell out the exact parts off egypt origins at the most i can only hope that someone will research into the name story from egypt and not his fanboy fantasies from greece to put forth a credible understanding if not already done then perhaps someone can put up that as reliable secondary source on the internet and can be referred to here,0

ok obiwan youre starting to make me suspicious what do you always ask exactly what i think are the right questions own up either way you did not answer my question directly and i also suspect you know it does this mean that wpo is not useful to you but you did answer it indirectly so you get an even more direct question in return why make it obvious that you know a lot about wikipedia without telling us that you find it useful when you are a very direct person otherwise for one you are calling them out on the most inconvenient of all questions for them if you dont mind im going to take this straight to the source wpo peeps what the dealio ive asked people on wp to put up or shut up ive asked the wmf to walk their talk in fact ive staked my rep several times now and im not done yet now im asking you why dont you stop whining for once and show people you can actually do better onwiki or off obiwan certainly isnt the first to question your selfrighteous assertions on how to build an online encyclopedia better than wikipedia i for one have been wondering for a while now so lets see what you can do besides making snarky personal comments heres a pot and heres a kettle need i mention what color they are onwards with obiwans points i dont believe in nasty people deciding anyone is bad nasty etc has only one purpose one can feel better about being bad nasty etc to people theyve so judged i dont think this is particularly productive in fact imo it is unbelievably destructive once someone decides or more often others have convinced them that they themselves are bad people we could talk about this more in another thread but weve got to get back on topic here so you know that the wikipediocrats are smart you have spent more time there than youre willing to admit directly i immediately wonder if its just in reading or in writing too they are indeed among the smartest in the wp community reasoningwise that ive met so far but emotionally less than average how do you think many of these smart mer fers ended up getting indef blocked or banned a lot of them fell from grace not because they werent an asset to the community but because they didnt seem to know when or they were completely unwilling to stop fighting for what they saw as justice thats one part of the answer many of them are banned or blocked whether rightly so or not from editing on wikipedia also its normal for someone who has been banished to tell themselves they wish harm on their homeland while still keeping a great emotional investment in it youll hear the same people spout their disdain for wikipedia almost in the same breath as suggestion to improve it frankly we could speculate about these peoples motives and methods til the sun goes down lets be more practical about what is best for wikipedia here what we as a wikipedia community cant do is ignore them away and even if we could were doing a pisspoor job of it because i almost always hear about whats been said on name from a wikipedian before i go to the actual site ultimately i go back to my old standard i dont give a shit where these people come from or what their motives are alls i know is that they are saying something interesting and i appreciate the fact that i dont have to gloss over a bunch of posts that are trying to get them to shut up as i read it obiwan no use playing coy you know exactly what im talking about d,0

im not sure that this section represents fact over speculation properly both of the section discourages turnout and participation and neutralizes turnout disparities between states offer a speculative opinion without factual backup yet their unabridged existence in this article assumes both sections to consist of factual statements these should probably be quoted sourced or begin similar to supports of the electoral college may argue or supports of electoral college reform may argue,0
this article is extremly bias how can you guys put more bias torwards one person than you do the holocaust so he has been sued many people have been sued but its not the focal point of their article isnt the point of wikipedia to be unbias you can at least add a nuetrality dispute to the top of the page there are many people against the fda and what not so not saying there is any evidence is stupid and to say his book is taking other peoples works and putting them into one book is also stuid a lot of books are other peoples works its called citations wikipedia is other peoples works wikipedia has tons of backlash against it and thats not the focal point of wikipedias wikipedia article so why is this one article so bias when i havent seen any others that are this blatent,0

thanks from my point of view there are differences and parallels between the two concepts one parallel is that both concepts are intending a territory with a homogeneous population the difference is the concept of racial hygiene is intending a homogeneous population regarding the criterium race whatever race might be the concept of ethnically homogeneous states is intending a homogeneous population regarding the criterium ethnicity a second difference is that the concept of racial hygiene has led to more extreme forms and methods in political practice in history example the holocaust not only expulsion but also extinction of millions of people in an industrially organised process user nov 17th,0

i think the information given in wikipedia about the languages spoken in the sahrawi arab democratic republic is manipulated only reports the official language of the sadr and languages spoken native why languages spoken native because they simply reported languages spoken as if reported in the wikipedia page of western sahara i really believe that you are using this formula spoken native language not to include the spanish language as spoken in the sadr who will believe that a country has spanish as second administrative language and no one speaks the language even as a foreign language i do believe that the page of the sadr in wikipedia is manipulated and politicized by editors moroccan and expansionist name deluded think that the lack of a second language vacuum administrative sadr will favor the english language occupies that place to the i say that you are wasting your time like it or not the spanish language and will be the second administrative language of the sahrawi arab democratic republic today and tomorow,0

philosopher rfc philosopher from wiktionary a person devoted to studying and producing results in philosophy i am going to make the case that we must call name a philosopher without qualifiers in the lead this is not done as an endorsement or statement about the level of achievement or acceptance of his philosophy only that it is his career note not all of the sources i use below are in the article at present the point here is to first convince rfc respondents that philosopher is accurate and widely accepted then we can make sure the most reliable ones are in place definitions obviously each source is going to use slightly different phrasing some will call him explicitly a philosopher or has views on philosophy but i think you should consider some other phrases given below as equivalent using one word philosopher in the lead sentence covers all of his political ethical and theistic specializations in one word which we then elaborate on later in the article philosophical conversation philosophy show used to describe his freedomain radio series libertarian libertarian thinker libertarianism is a classification of political philosophies anarchocapitalist anarchocapitalism is a political philosophy voluntaryist voluntaryism or sometimes voluntarism is a libertarian philosophy athiest arguments for atheism range from the philosophical to social and historical approaches ethics ethics sometimes known as philosophical ethics ethical theory moral theory and moral philosophy is a branch of philosophy secular ethics secular ethics is a branch of moral philosophy primary source as name is a living person we should give great weight to what he says is the focus of his work and his stated profession unless there is reliable evidence to contradict him obviously we dont want to host any sort of fringe claims if we are to dispute what he says about himself though then we absolutely must have a strong basis for this or we open wikipedia to discredit or liability this is why blps are held to strong standards in the first place i think in this case there is strong and ample evidence that calling himself a philosopher is justified and correct he is a modern philosopher that explores via modern online media which is obviously a very new phenomenon and so its understandable that its different than the oldschool philosophers were used to freedomain radio about page my masters thesis analyzing the political implications of the philosophies i have been fascinated by philosophy particularly moral theories since my midteens i left my career as a software entrepreneur and executive to pursue philosophy full time through my work here at freedomain radio i have written a number of novels as well as many free books on philosophy freedomain radio the show that molyneux hosts has the tagline the largest and most popular philosophical conversation in the world molyneuxs books show that he is endeavoring to produce tangible written results in the field of philosophy particularly universally preferable behaviour upb a rational proof of secular ethics and against the gods a concise guide to atheism and agnosticism which are two of his more deep dives into the fundamental philosophies strong atheism the case for evacuating the middle ground article why i am a philosopher video a response to questions about my childhood motivations for pursuing philosophy an introduction to philosophy part video course produced by molyneux describing basic philosophical concepts reality knowledge truth godsreligion ethics and politics unsolvable philosophical questions solved video tackles great philosophical questions considered unanswerable proofs for god destroyed by a philosophical atheist video a philosophical review discusses the major philosophical political economic and social developments of video philosophy questio,0

being opposed to lgbt philosophy or movement doesnt make somebody an homophobe exactly as defending israel policies doesnt make somebody a racist or being opposed to judaism doesnt make somebody an antisemite nb settleman from recently you have started adding material from both sides but you dont comply with npov yet anyway you have some ideas of what is the pov of opponents to some israeli policies but when you write an article on such a topic it is not enough to google for some articles about what they say you have to understand their arguments as well as you understand those that you sharelisten daytoday and put all of them in article in order that everybody understand them you also have to introduce their arguments fairly so that they can be understood the big issue for you will be that on the statistical point of view you should face of time arguments from the other side partly stronger than the ones you believe in how will you manage this if your are proisrael and revendicate this or the right to be so on wp as a good start you could start by trying to understand the muslim and the palestinian point of view regarding name and introducing this on the article your recently created,0

under such criteria you better be inserting notability templates into each and every unsourced article that exists since we have had unsourced blps in wikipedia for years that is not sufficient criteria for determining if something is notable or not the standard is if such could be found there are already several sources in the article about several european groups in mexico such as the mennonites and spanish refugees could the article be improved definitely but notability is not an issue except to those who beleive that europeans or whites do not or better stated should not exist in latin america,0

none beefart replies thanks for you comments few take the time to discuss grammar on wikipedia and it shows in many articles i disagree with you about none the word comes from the old norse ne an which means literally no one in my view to get the sense of any usage of none we must expand it in our minds to no one it is impossible to say no one are dinosaurs it has to be no one is a dinosaur here are two examples from the oed name except for her eyes none of her features was remarkable name people sought her but none was a companion however the plot thickens because the oed also gives this example from name who is highly regarded as a writer none of our wives are invited this flies in the face of the first two examples and suggests that the oed has given up the fight maybe i ought to as well there are of course some situations where expanding none to no one does not make any sense as either a singular or a plural eg none of the increase is due to here the best we can hope for is to propose that none is a synonym for nothing i personally try to avoid expressions such as none of the increase and would be inclined to write no part of the increase,0
xenodontlikeit typically when name sees a valid edit by wiki policy that he disapproves of for whatever reason he seeks to get others to remove it this strategy is quite effective as he says the edit needs balance or needs the proper context or isnt the full story etc there are many different reasons used but the end result is him adding so much trivial nonsense to ratio in his pov that average editors cringe when they see it name then declares that the original unbalanced pov version can only stay if his even more unbalanced additions are there to provide proper balance this leads to edit warring over days and even weeks articles often get locked down some reasonable and responsible editors step in and remove it all in the name of peace and to move forward in improving the article name gets what he wanted all along and boosts his edit count with the disruptive edit warring some call this tactic a form of wikiterrorism i say it shows that name is quite calculated and intelligent not a terrorist even though he is mostly obtuse during discussions,0

another specific example under genetic explanations wrn has written this to support these claims they often cite several lines of evidence that they interpret as support for a partly genetic cause of group differences in iq black white east asian differences in iq reaction time and brain size are observed worldwide in a range of cultures and environments in the united states significant blackwhite iq differences are observable at every age above years within every occupation or socioeconomic level tested in every region of the country and at every time since the invention of ability tests name and other have argued that the magnitude of race differences on different iq subtests correlate with the extent to which those subtests measures g which also correlates with measures of the subtests heritability from these and other findings they argue that race differences have a partly biological basis the rising heritability of iq with age within all races studies have found on average in the developed world heritability starts at in infants rises to in middle childhood and peaks at in adulthood and studies showing the virtual disappearance by adulthood of shared environmental effects on iq for example family income education and home environment with adopted siblings partaking in the studies no more similar in iq than with strangers from these studies they argue that most suggested environmental explanations for iq difference between groups do not have a strong enough effect on iq to fully account for group differences studies of us comparisons of both parents to children and siblings to each other finding regression to differing means for different races for blacks and for whites across the entire range of iqs despite the fact that siblings are matched for shared environment and genetic heritage with regression unaffected by family socioeconomic status and generation examined this seems to be excessive detail wrn has essentially recreated rushtonname arguments and placed citations in his citation this essentially allows wrn to write an entire section as if it were incontrovertible based on various references without any possible response the npov fact that should be reported is that rushton and name make some assertions not that they make some assertions and here is the factual evidence they use to back it up if anything every one of their lines of evidence should be attributed directly to rushton and name as much of that same evidence may be interpreted as undermining the genetic hypothesis depending on the viewer it seems very weaselly in any case can we agree these four points should be removed from the article comments,0

dkw racing engine of the 1930s i remember reading about a dkw racing motorcycle engine with three cylinders but one combustion chamber in essence the two outside cylinders were mounted vertically and formed a twingle or splitsingle unit while the middle cylinder was mounted horizontally facing forward in the frame had a larger bore and a smaller stroke and was essentially a supercharger for the other cylinders does anyone have any documentation for this engine i think the motorcycles it powered were successful racers at the time,0

sure i dont have the necessary knowledge to correct these sections the most egregious error is the following statement his system of government which may be described as a benevolent despotism was perhaps that best suited to the character of his subjects this passive construction raises the questions benevolent for whom described by whom it implies that the name were unable to govern themselves and needed a wise father to gently raise them into civilization if this is true it needs a citation but im sure there were plenty of trade unionists and republicans who disagreed at least slightly the following phrases read as excessively fawning slightly biased or perhaps just worded in an oldfashioned style the young highlander whose keen patriotism capability for leadership and poetic talents early displayed themselves showed no inclination for the pleasures of the french capital and eagerly looked forward to returning to his native land he gave montenegro its first constitution in following pressure from a population eager for more freedom king nikola was gifted with a fine physique and a commanding presence was a successful military leader and a graceful poet i hope this helps so that someone who has the knowledge to do the edits can update the article accordingly,0

hound stalk harass but that does not mean anything here yet such editors go unmarked at all while it is a most grievous sin to point out that talkkochfamilyarchive1 appears to violate wpblp on its face my fault my fault my most grievous fault for thinking that wikipedias most important policies are actually important while folks like ip2600 can go around stalking hounding and harassing and no one does a single damn thing about them at all,0
you cannot take a practice engaged in by a negligible proportion of all the males who live or have ever lived on this planet and imply that this is what men do everywhere i have looked around and the other options i have encountered is bachelor hug which is both very rare and nonsensical and pound hug which makes a lot more sense and seems about as popular as hip hop hug as long as we mention both in the article i would have no problem with pound hug by the way why did my redirect fail i was going to append an explanation but the servers were soooo slow i ran out of time and had to run to an appointment,0
thanks name,0
i read the cited reference it is extremely vague about actual facts all i can discern is that name wrote name not the kgb offering public relations advice the specific contents are not mentioned at all this makes me extremely suspicious no sourcing for the treason language was provided it appears that possibly some blog used the term if you care to rewrite it please focus very carefully on the actual facts presented in the source and not their spin or interpretation cns is quite partisan all i could find was one fact satisfying both wprs and wpv that a poli sci prof said name offered public relations advice to name i think we should wait until the major press have had a go at it and some actual facts memo contents for example are available before spending a lot of energy on it derex,0

great discussion point jimbo although i dont think discussion is actually required the foundation should be able to just do this without the support of the users that are disputing the edits in really difficult disputed issues i agree the wikimedia foundation could hire experienced editors although i wouldnt support any wikipedia connected interviewers use and pay someone totally independent independent notable reporters to interview and report on the problematic content issue and report that in a wprs source thus giving full independent closure to the dispute,0

so you want me to lie and say le grand did nothing wrong i think you should look through more of his afd comments many times he lists the dont destroy essay with wikipedia policies lumping those together with no clarification on what is what isnt the correct thing to do im sure many people do click the essay and see its opinion but there is others that just assume its policy due to it being listed with a bunch of other policies im not an expert on the unblock policy but i dont think this is part of it i see this therefore if you want to dig yourself out of this hole your first step would be to understand and acknowledge that grc hasnt been doing anything wrong this last year as very disrespectful to my views in general an admin shouldnt be posting like that period,0

really if no intermarrying occured then perhaps you can explain why people from nationalist background ended up with anglo surnames like name and why people from the ulsterscots background have irish gaelic surnames like name if you honestly believe that there was no intermarriage between the planters and natives then you are brain washed and deluded than the average loyalist and thats saying something it did happen they intermixed for over two hundred years and when the ulster scots went to america they identified themselves as irish respectable accademicahahhaha,0

water in the coliseum fwiw i watched a program on the name channel a couple of months ago the focus of which was a chemical study of the makeup of the plaster used in the coliseum and examination of the flooding and drainage facilities the romans had built into the coliseum the program concluded that the plaster used contained small but notable amounts of the substance that the romans used in aqueducts for waterproofing but not enough that it was designed to be a permanent feature of the arena it also concluded that the coliseum could have been flooded overnight and that it was probably built with it being flooded shortly after completion but not again after that in mind i can t find in the brief search i ve just done anything i can cite so i m not going to put it into the article yet but i d say that the section relating to the flooding of the coliseum is probably slightly out of date,0

ive never seen creative director used in the infobox for tv shows because creative director is not a title actually held by someone at least in fictional series to the best of my knowledge it is production designer and thats what theyre credited as it also looks quite odd in the infobox where you have someone who is the production designer listed so high in the infobox just below the creator and above more notable roles such as the cast and executive producers this is a good topic of discussion for templateinfobox television that creativedirector should be changed to productiondesigner in the infobox and then moved into the production portion of the infobox along with other similar crew roles,0
hi how are you today ive been looking over your fetal alcohol work and its pretty sharp my dads a doc and he did a lot of work at johns hokins with that he looked at it too good work so yeah the will mcwhinney article certainly has you all in a tizzy im not looking to out anyone or anyhting its just gotten to the point that well i think theres a reason and other people too to read about this fascinating community activist i was telling will beback ive been a memebr of sierra club since i was akid my parents enlisted me and made some rather large donations in my name throughout my life and ive done the same wiht my own children its a cool way to move things forward like that movie but hoefulyl much less trite anyhow whats the good word with you today i think of our battles more like the old warner brothers cartoon with the coyote and the sheepdog punching in before they set out to undermine one another because thats whats happening here im actualyl writing some pretty solid stuff here and you and will beback are bending over backwards to break rules and uphold them agaijnst me look over at biff rose there was a flargrant violation of the 3rr standard and i pointed out that to will beback that each time i made that violation i was blocked and banned i see that the person who did it this time was not blocked or banned so you know ive got a whole list of these that is being sandboxed by another ip to follow up on as i told will you need to play fair for me to adhere to any standards you want to uphold you cant just block an article because true information is being disseminated through it well you can but its against the wiki rules and so you are in violation though i dont really think you care anyhow hope you keep your head above water and il name you at the fights so to speak have a good day ill remain civil as long as you do but you ve got to remain civil in your actions too ok ok,0

the lead is quite unbalanced as it is supposed to be a brief summary and introduction to the main text and yet is about historicalculturalreligious aspects of circumcision which only occupies a small portion of the article itself i agree that information in the lead should be in the article under the relevant section perhaps as the opening paragraph but given there are already articles for religious practices it is unnecessary in the lead it could be reduced to one or two short sentences that state that there have been and still are historical cultural and religious practices that involve circumcision but without going into detail this is a medical article and the use of circumcision as an initiation ritual is a different subject to medical circumcision only where medical circumcision has itself become part of cultural practice should there be a focus on that manifestation of circumcision as cultural practice,0

troublesome sentence paleolithic europeans seem to have been a homogenous population possibly due to a population bottleneck or nearextinction event on the iberian peninsula where a small human population is thought to have survived the glaciation and then expanded into europe during the name period this is false i cannot recall any study which asserts confidently that palaeolithic europe was genetically homogeneous if there is one it would require inline citation i think whoever wrote the sentence has confused themselves the studies have rather shown that name europe became more homogenepus because of population bottlenecking with subsequent expansion the bottlenecking did not cause a homogeneous palaeolithic population becuase the events occurred subsequently,0

thanks moonriddengirl wikidea im sure youre an excellent lawyer and i admire your goal to turn wikipedia into a superior reference work for law students its one i share with one amendment wikipedia is not a legal resource for lawyers and law students it is not a casebook it is not a practitioners text it is a work for the laypeople to explain as simply as possible in this case how the law works thats what you should aspire to with your articles and its what i aspire to with mine the layperson is more helped by thirdparty references and summaries than to them unintelligible case citations and full body quotations from judgments while such quotations and citations have their place this i feel uses such case citations well but i might be a teensy bit biased they are the obiter not the ratio,0

also depending on the article you will look at the socioeconomic equality reason will vary the violence was undoubtedly racial its prime targets were the chinese merchants who have flocked to tibet by road and on a prestigious new train across the roof of the world the mobs were the losers of lhasa the poor who seethe with resentment outwitted commercially by chinese traders outgunned by the chinese army and many fear ultimately to be outnumbered by chinese migrants now this is straight from the horses mouth the actual western journalist who was there wrote this not some msm that decided to twist the sources words i thought it was the most npov and fair way to just say they were angry about socioeconomic inequality inflation and fear of becoming a minority in their own city why is that wrong its the most concise fair and npov way to state what they were angry about which caused the rioting,0

i dont want to reopen the issue as the issue was never actually solved wikipedia policies are pretty clear on what consititutes a valid source for any topic and childrens books and books not about the specific topic but that happen to mention it as an aside based upon no real knowledge of the topic clearly do not count instead of just blind reverting changes id like someone to try to come up with some sort of justification within wikipedia policies that would make including such weak and nonacademic references as sources whenever a source is in question it should be up to the person who wants them to stay to provide reasons not to just keep them come hell or high water because of some peoples bias against editors who arent signed in these changes were badly needed and seemingly the only reason they were undone was by one editor who thinks he wpowns the article and others who violated wpagf and assumed that an anon user must be up to no good,0

i am not sure if i understand your reply above correctly unsd uses the term statistics divisions i agree but the term refers to divisions in the un headquarter or agencies in different countries not a specific way of geographic divisions of the world you still prefer previous title ie united nations statistical divisions to the current one ie united nations geoscheme if so please allow me to repeat a bit on the following the term statistics divisioncapitalized singular form in the un context refers to the organization of united nations statistics division with the website at unstatsunorg the term statistical divisionsplural form can mean any categorization schemes not just geographical ones google this statistical divisions siteunorg the term statistical divisionsplural form can also mean any organization bodies who are doing statisitcal work in governments google this statistical divisions siteunorg therefore it is not advisable to use the ambigous general term statistical divisions or the wrong organization term statistics division to refer to un m un statistical divisions can refer to any agencies doing statisitcal work under the un system or imply that there are certain un statistical categorization schemes in a general sense not geographical i agree that un geoscheme is widely used for stastitcs and also mapping natural earth has regionun and subregion metadata for each country i use it quiet often it is why i notice that most of academic work refer this geographic categorizationclassification scheme as un geoscheme try google book search and you will find at least the following the best option to identify the states from asia could be use the united nations un geoscheme for asia as per this asia is subdivided to four broad categories the un geoscheme defines the region as all states of mainland north america south of the united states conversely the european union excludes belize and mexico from its definition of the region country groups are based on un geoscheme and world bank regional classification were grouped into regions and subregions based on the united nations geoscheme unsdmethodsm49m49reginhtm that the united nations statistics division would later classify as eastern asia southern asia and southeastern asia according to its geoscheme in fact i also agree that many un agencies in fact many other reports consultancies etc have different statistical divisions in the general sense of categorization schemes for research this is exactly why i believe the term un geoscheme is better although it is not official term or a technical term un m i have not yet found an ambigous use of the term correct me if i am wrong on this so far every online and academic citations that i have found when the term un geoscheme is used it refers to exactly the regions and subregions as defined in un m moving forwards since dont have the time nor will to take it to rm and if you do not have any further couterevidence or arguments with the evidence and claims that i layed out above i can help by making the necessary editing without going to rm of course if you still have lingering concerns please summarize your current arguments preferrably after considering the evidence that i have already presented and new evidencecitations here before i bring it to rm comparingchinese wikipedia vs baidu baike by name,0

november utc fuck off your accusations are baseless your writing style is atrocious prose means prose not fluff,1
utc really its not im australian dont regard myself as a pcpusher but id think uluru has moved ahead of ayers rock as the preferred name by most people certainly when i was younger in the 1980s it was pretty much unheard of to say uluru and anything other than name made you look like some sort of lefty nutter but in the last years or so its changed oh and using qantas as an example is probably not ideal the airport they fly to is called name so its understandable theyd prefer that name anyway just my 2c june,0

please try to be constructive and understand that an ecyclopedia should not contain unsourced claims such as the previous claim that tried to convince people that there is a legal problem it seems that you are not constructive as you support people who try to add unsourced claims i removed a maintenance tag that is nonsense as it cannot be resolved the way the initiator likes to i could however agree that we keep the maintenance tag for a while to give people the chance to give a verification for their related claim not to be alleged if nobody is able to prove that there is a legal problem which is what i expect as nobody could prove that claim during the past years we of course need to keep alleged,0

i like that criteria so you are saying only those drugs that are actually approved for human testing with a separation of approved for alcoholism with a reliable source naming at least one country where it is specifically approved for alcoholism with proper notations on any other countries where it is in the trial stage under investigation with a reliable source stating that it is currently in human trials for alcoholism now do you still want an experimental section for drugs not approved for alcoholism but approved for other treatments,0

my 2c to get beyond the stalemale is to let skeptics raise all controversies surrounding chiropractic find the best sources to neutrally present the material and roll into into a criticisms section then those who really care about intricacies and details of the chiropractic story can get on with the show and make the article interesting and not some big statsresearch battleground for the record i completely agree that effectiveness of chiropractic care is well established for low back disorders just as good if not better that manual therapy is effectiveness in neck pain task force that the results seem favourable for certain types of headaches tth migraine cervicogenicheadache of cervical origin and inconclusive and controversial for nonmusculoskeletal disorders part of effectiveness too is patient satisfaction scores which patients routinely display a far greater preference for chiropractic care than medical care for lbp this is the most succint and precise summary there is we can toss the reference in and call it a day a majority of editors agree that the current and past evidence both in research and 3rd parties governments favours chiropractic care we cant let name conclusions which have been rebutted and invalidated skew what is now generally accepted notice the terms too generally etc,0

states courts i have been putting all articles dealing with state law and state courts and their judges under the foo law subcategory for each us foo state this at least puts everything involving law and its administration in one place while the courts are of course part of government in some states their articles were so dominating the government category that the executive and legislative articles were losing out i can certainly see putting a see also notice at the top of each government of foo category to point to the foo law category communications communications of course encompasses media and also telephone area codes and mail zip codes and internet etc i see no differenece to be made at the us level versus the state level not sure that media is of such overwhelming importance at the state level however that it needs to be in multiple places or at the state level thanks,0

july utc no i didnt liken you to a dog thats just an expression that means things are going downhill iow civil fringe pov pushers are being handed concessions and being allowed to do things their own way more and more in spite of recent improvements in the way were supposed to handle fringe beliefs in this case allowing a onesided pov driven and dubious interpretation of a guideline to be used to violate my userspace that was indeed uncivil and very impolite bang done no discussion or request i am shocked and disheartened by these actions by someone i respected thats all was what i said uncomfortable for you sure but not incivil you have chosen your agenda and it is not incivil to point out what it is you do it to me all the time without me running to mommy and complaining about incivility when youre getting your way you are very tough and civil somehow you expect that you can tread on people and just get away with it by calling their comments incivil you really do misuse that card by playing it too often when you become perfect then you can start pointing fingers keep in mind that you have the dubious honor of being considered one of the most classic and highly skilled cases of a disruptive civil pov pusher as i recall you may have even been the pioneer developer of the technique your civility covers an agenda that is counterproductive to npov by inevitably seeking to wikilawyer stonewall and censure anything negative about namepractic no matter how well sourced when were actually supposed to follow the sources thats just wrong since this is names user page its probably best that this discussion not continue here or even continue at all since we never get anywhere i just wanted to set the record straight that i certainly wasnt comparing you to a dog i actually do have much higher opinions of you i admire intelligence i just wish it wasnt being used for such a nefarious and and nonnpov purpose as to protect namepractics reputation in the real world that is good from your pov name advocacy and protectionism but here we follow the sources and let them speak,0

well it now appears i am fighting against two deceivers instead of just a single one so the difference between her maintaining that she contracted herpes from adult filming activities and her actually contracting herpes from adult filming activities is huge is it in fact that huge or is simply perceived by you to be huge is it honestly or dishonestly perceived by you to be huge is it honestly perceived by you to be small but dishonestly communicated by you to the public to be huge your reasoning skills are mediocre which is why you should stick to using wikipedia as a freespeech read propaganda tool and refrain from actually publishing anything on paper that may be handed down to future generations considering that anyone would do the world the disservice of actually publishing anything produced by you veritas semper,0

name agree dr name have the final word about name genetic signatures he more than anyone else is the most credible person that can publish articles and true informations about name genetic signatures not name he was the one who discovered the cmh in after years he came out to announce in that he and his research team have discovered not one but two name which he called j1 and j2 name name rappaport shapiro kovacsname are all j2 those surnames and families are the most prestigious name families today they are all name j2 j2 name is much more common than j1 name name reported that pinchas the zealot mentioned in the bible may be the origin of j2 this is a very important information that confirms matematical historic and genealogy facts name was the son of eleazar name was his brother out of the name houses did belong to eleazarpinchas while only came out from name seed eleazarpinchas j2 had a much larger population than name all name genealogy were divided into those two houses until the destruction of the second temple so if name is the origin of all name j2 than it makes sense since his name seed produced much more descendants than his brother name so it is very normal and logical to understand why genetic cohanim signatures presents two cmhs wich is the caracteristics of the two houses of name all genealogic tree for name since name until today are still divided into these two houses eleazarpinchas and name during the years of the cohanim services mishkan and name the name jews were always selected by the houses from pinchas and only from name that s why j2 name is almost twice as common than j1 name preceding unsigned comment added by whaaaat during the years of the cohanim services mishkan and name the name jews were always selected by the houses from pinchas and only from name that s why j2 name is almost twice as common than j1 name lol d please stop being stupid and be real j1 if for real jews arabisraelites decent and j2 is for goyim jewsfalse jews agree dr name of the rambantechnion medical center in haifa who is renowned for his discovery in of the name genetic signature reported in that he and his research team have discovered not one but two name which he called j1 and j2 pinchas the zealot mentioned in the bible may be the origin of j2 he suggested the extended cmh is established for j1 name only if somebody in j1 also has cmh then he is likely to have name ancestry j1 name form a tight network around cmh but this is not the case for j2 the cmh does not apply to j2 if a j2 is in cmh it tells us nothing about one being a name in j2 the cmh has no special status the j1 lineage of name in cmh could be much more recent jewish name in j2 form a much larger network around cmh than jewish name in j1 do name jews belong mainly to haplogroup j2 because name as a group j1j2 have a high frequency of j2 the j2 name have much more ancient common ancestor according to the observed mutation rate which is three times faster than the standard effective rate j2 name serves as the deep background of the priestly jewish caste j1j2 the finding of j2 among contemporary name can lend credence that today s name j1j2 may be descendents of two different founding dynasties including coalescence to name as the founder of j2 name concluded dr name why the confirmation that name may be the orign of j2 name is so important pinchas son of elazar son of aharon the name turned back my anger from upon the children of yisrael so i did not destroy the children of yisrael therefore say behold i give to him my covenant of peace numbers god gave to pinchas a new permanent priesthood for him and his descendants for all generations name 124a god indicated that name had acted justly by rewarding him with the most counterintuitive form of blessing an allnew form of priesthood he is given the divine covenant of peace and the gift of eternal priesthood zadok a des,0

article evaluation article evaluation for this assignment i was tasked to analyze and comment on the article about change management the first paragraph includes useful and clear overview of the topic however it could use a little more information that would broaden the interests of readers they key points in this article are based on historical occurrences that have contributed to rapid changing events in the workforce and that also created a standard for change management in a way the information includes sufficient information regarding the history and the context of this topic it most definitely covers a variety of topics including the reasons for such change in addition to that the article addresses the key issues including globalization and technology that have heavily influenced change management there is therefore well supported evidence throughout the article and the analysis of certain models proves that the article is referenced and can be proven with contextual information the article itself has a clear focus on a topic and also includes detailed scholarly support throughout the text which can be found in the reference section the contribution considers a variety of perspectives however i think it primarily focuses on today s rapidly changing world in reference towards globalization and technology and maybe could focus more than just a few scholars it takes an appropriate tone in providing points of view in the context of globalization and technology and is supported with appropriate references throughout the page i think for this article there are sufficient references but more references can always be beneficial and offer more content the article represents a neutral point of view but in a way is sort of drawn towards today s issues in terms of globalization and technology and offers a certain point of view it does a good job staying with the facts and avoiding opinions in terms of article length the only thing i would suggest is a longer intro with a little more information for the reader to have overall it s a well written entry with detailed information about change management i couldn t find any grammatical errors or any misspellings and the text itself reads well and expresses good ideas in terms of structure i would only add more information to the introduction to give the reader more background knowledge,0

addressing while indian tribe is official us name lingo saying tribe twice in the first sentence and then again in the second is awkward also the tribe is not a monolithic entity but rather a collection of people so maybe reword to say something like the coeur dalene people once inhabited acres ha in northern idaho and washington and montana actually note article on the tribe but today the only land controlled by the tribal nation is the coeur dalene reservation in benewah and kootenai counties idaho you dont have to use my wording but you see how i am distinguishing land and people though the two are of course closely intertwined name second and third paragraphs jump around and need another copyedit id put right up front that name did the executive order but congress never acted on it then go on about how the tribe didnt accept it anyway keep the chronology clearer interesting that the coeur dalene article says nothing about this period maybe finish here and add a bit to that article too hmmm from a very cursory review of the decision it appears that gap between creation of the reservation and idahos statehood becomes significant in this case so perhaps give us a bit of foreshadowing that this is not just a dry fact but its something thats going to matter the section fails to draw out the significance of the info on the state park and mining maybe add a wee bit to hint at why this will matter in the scotus case,0

as much as human rights and ethnic rights should be respected spray painting every possible detail of unverifiable information on the rohingya and getting around the verification by claiming that the information was destroyed by an interested party are not valid reasons for having a list of villages where a certain group of people live there is already a lot of articles on the arakanese people and state that have no concern of the rohingya but include them for the sake of brotherly respect this is pushing the line a bit far rohingyas should be treated fairly i do not contest that but articles like this one are pure selfpitying and clutters wikipedia with absolutely useless information i wonder when will somebody change the name of the article on burmamyanmar on wiki to country where the rohingya are persecuted rather a brief mention of where the rohingyas reside should be placed if desired on the main article on rakhine state albeit short and concise not dump an entire list of names copied directly from some publication with all due respect this article should be deleted,0

as far as i can tell learned people dont express their opinions as either vatican ii is infallible or vatican ii is not infallible everyone is pretty much agreed that ecumenical councils exercise their infallibility via the promulgation of dogmatic definitions so the question really is whether vatican ii promulgated any dogmatic definitions even the famous pope paul vi quote that traditional catholics always cite uses this terminology there are those who ask what authority what theological qualification the council intended to give to its teachings knowing that it avoided issuing solemn dogmatic definitions backed by the churchs infallible teaching authority the answer is known by those who remember the conciliar declaration of march repeated on november in view of the pastoral nature of the council it avoided proclaiming in an extraordinary manner any dogmas carrying the mark of infallibility general audience december published in the losservatore romano,0
i anticipated that is precisely what you would do i see there is no need to respond there as you have been properly counseled by the first responder take this under advisement there are editors on wikipedia it s amazing the system runs as smoothly as it does you need to do a self appraisal as to why you behave as you do you strike me as the type who has to win at all cost if that is indeed your underlying need it would help if you didn t a go out of your way to provoke confrontation you might have elected to not post your very first unhelpful post and b not be so wrong about things in the first place read name s just take that under advisementso you don t feel like you ve been somehow disgraced and have some honor to defend or other such horsecrap you are perfectly free to delete this thread if you don t then i will in hours please drop this now i spent several hours making that animation and all i have as my reward is stepping ankledeep in my dealings with you wikipedia is supposed to be a rewarding hobby so far that attribute has been elusive the last hours or so here for me happy editing talk,0

no jp is not a good source and i will remove it pending a better source my issue is jp has an agenda i came across them when checking the edit which one editor put in but they seemed very keen on jp when one editor used it to say muslims were a tiny tiny percentage i never knew jp up until then see the edit history for this edit now here is what i do know go and look at all the notable name start with name what is his religion muslim what i am realizing is most serer are muslim people synergistic is not unique to africa it is in every corner of the planet where islam and christianity live so islam accommodates this all the key historian on islam say this especially name and others vodon per kwami is a good example even in the caribbean google name in the morning vodon in the evening these people are classified as christian i do not think we will get exact stats but should not go with the pov that most serer practices their religion which is a myth note any strange ip edits can be investigated,0

good point but i cant help to notice the editing history of this article and how it reflects continued polarization against and for it im not going to implement the same edits again in the reception and criticism section if they are once again reversed i still support the truism that most rpgplayers with an opinion on this game either love it or hate it and that the game technically is a sequel within the final fantasy universe name is simply a direct sequel but like i said if you guys do not want that edit to stay in the r and c section i will not include it again in the same context since it seems so far that several people disagree with that last sentence,0

the books of maccabees and the name refer to the land and nation as israel throughout this period and the term is still used in acts the hasmonean kingdom was certainly not called judaea as this ia a latinized name and the hasmoneans are prior to the roman period similarly as explained in the article it was only after herod the great that the roman expanded the usage of their term judaea to include more or less the entire region that herod had ruled maccabees and the nt are the primary sources referring to the land and nation as israel for a modern academic publication secondary source see for example king herod a persecuted persecutor a case study in psychohistory and psychobiography by aryeh kasher eliezer witztum name where herod is clearly referred to as king of israel and eg a survey of israels history by name name name which refers to the hasmonean ruling over israel or say the holocaust roots history and aftermath name westview press which similarly speaks of hasmonean israel,0

its a stupid project wikipedia should be a hub of information for all ages if it is filled up with porno articles with inappropriate material both encyclopedic and for the reading of the general population child or otherwise then it is restricting the audience of wikipedia surely i mean how can a source of information be free and accessible to all if it is ostensibly linked with explicit material most of which shouldnt be in the encyclopedia ps i know about wikipedias no censorship issue but sometimes it goes too far,1
nope this is absolutely congruent with the material immediately preceding is relevant to how the campaigns treated the issue of jtp is relevant to the later section on jtp having a new 501c3 starting up etc the source is not only reliable it is succinct and does not use excess verbiage at all would you prefer that the emails end up here or just the facts as published,0

pretty much what i said the first day this was posted now i have neither a problem with the cabals decision nor in the cabals logic as deamon138 does my concern is why a vote that basically said i dont know means it stays at burma by the cabals conclusionif the article had happened to be frozen at myanmar before the mediation and we had the same cabal it would now be a myanmar article i can see where the myanmar side would be unhappy however why should the burma side agree to abide by the next decision you can bet that with every panel of mediators that might side with myanmar you will find at least as many panels that side with burma husond is right where does this end when i first looked at this mess i said and posted that with the current evidence on both sides editors and mediators will not be able to reach a fair compromise that will appease both sides of this issue no matter how much thought is put into it there are good points for each argument im in the burma camp but that is how i see things so im looking at leave it where it is now split it into identical articles some bizarre bot that switches it back and forth daily a new type of mediation that imho will not end this by any stretch of the imagination choice just doesnt look that appealing,0
march utc yes the presentation of god and cosmology in tub is exactly that and so is just a fact of the book if one was to summarize it in one single sentence that would be the only way i can think of to describe it npov npov though is somewhat nebulous with this book as we all have discovered because of the authorship origin and unusual unique presentation that has caused various types of pov to surface in debate true not true religion philosophy etc i searched in some online libraries at the library of congress and even wrote to the urantia foundation to inquire about the history of its official categorization in hopes this would help so far i found it listed under scientific religion religion nonfiction cults and got lost with all the changes due to copyright issues and various changes in status at the loc the book itself says it is an epochal revelation which is the fifth to the planet it describes itself as clearing up misconceptions regarding god deity and divinity religious science scientific religion esoteric cosmology religious cosmology what perhaps just writing this in a paragraph would be useful answering this would help to streamline the rest of the article while increasing it at the same time i think what are your thoughts you know if we wrote that the urantia book is an epochal revelation containing religioscientific cosmology there would then start more pov debating,0
welcome welcome to wikipedia my name is name aka i noticed that you were new and havent received any messages yet i just wanted to see how you were doing wikipedia can be a little intimidating at first since it uses different formatting than other sites that use html and css in the long run though youll find that the wikisyntax is a lot easier and faster than those other ways here are a few links to get you started how to edit a page editing policy conduct and structure tutorial picture tutorial how to write a great article there are a lot of policies and guides to read but i highly recommend reading over those first if you have any questions feel free to leave me a message on my talk page please be sure to sign your name on talk using four tildes to produce your name and the current date along with a link to your user page this way others know when you left a message and how to find you its easier than having to type out your name right i hope you enjoy contributing to wikipedia we can use all the help we can get have a nice day sincerely august utc,0
answer to osli73 those with leftist agenda cannot be considered neutral observers due to their denial of genocide and open onesidedness with serbs andor name see name resource for example when you mention name sources who are you referring to do you consider the international tribunal a name source name massacre is heavily based on internationa tribunals rulling eg name judgement and you are trying to destroy the article by inserting revisionist garbage with the purpose of morally equivating victims with aggressors who committed genocide the bottom line is alternative views do not matter what matters is coldharded facts from such sources as international tribunal human rights watch statesponsored research documentation centre international missing association or whatever the official name is etc when it comes to editing this article in a rational matter you are the only one who rejects international tribunals version of the article and seeks serbian or proserbian version of the article as you can see you are not succeeding and your edits dont stay longer than couple of hours people will not stand for your version of the article because this is wikipedia and you cannot force people to accept your opinion and reject already established facts by international crimes tribunal for former yugoslavia and other neutral credible sources,0

mr name i dont mean to be frank but your title does assert that so is a de factor a country when only a handful number of countries recognizes it as such the majority of the world still see it as a part of georgia after all it was and is a civilwar on top of that south ossetians abkahzians are russian citizens so this would mean that they are in fact part of the russian federation this is also the problem logically to call it as such is to recognize the regional sovereignty of that area therefore confirming that the region exist but many speak of it which confirms its existence now that the region is confirmed to exist what is this region part of it is for the most part still the georgian region its more to do with logic then pov my friend mr name im trying front with you whatsoever but that statement so war doesnt make sense to me however i think that the solution is probably like name said in regards to the vietnam article but this needs to stop any title can seem that it has a pov and can have great arguments to support it even though the title has good intentions so to debate it any further wouldnt do good every informational data base has a bias its just a question of how muchfurthermore im going to also defend the google searches because it a good way to see how many individuals speak of in reference to i am not saying that because everyone calls it as such then it should be so but the easier it is to find the better as illogical as that soundsin summation i second name we should have a etymology page that way it will be clear on who is using what name and why,0

name said my impression remainst that the only reason this article is so long and detailed is the attempt to disguise from the casual reader the fact that the entire thing can be shrugged off in a oneliner yes thats probably true but what is the alternative many of us have been battling to make the cmt clear but every time a statement is made on how crazy the theory is the other side asks for a proofcitation and since that has happened almost every week for the last six months and probably longer the article has grown in size im not sure how we can overcome this problem but im open to suggestions,0

thanks for the edits i am not aware of any split in the us between higher doctorates and others the phd dphil not awarded here in my experience is typically a or year degree but as that time period often includes mslevel classwork it seems parallel to your phd when awarded in the us the dsc is the precise equivalent of the phd the ranking you list divinity laws or civil law medicine and letters and above music is at least not well known in the us it would be helpful to include the degree names in the above list since i certainly dont know them all md is as you say a professional degree as is drph in public health i think the general attitude is to regard all doctoral degrees as on par and honorary degrees as strictly honorary and not pertaining to academic work this is something of a mess isnt it talk,0

is it scientific to attribute an event a to cause b where cause b was deliberate designed with some sort of intelligent intent dont answer the questions beyond that well the problem with not answering beyond that is that your example is completely rigged there are several major fundamental problems here first you completely fail to mention the fact that the intelligence behind id is quite literally not of this earth natural science might look at a honeycomb see it is built by bees and then find an odd looking fossilized honeycomb and theorize that it was made by odd looking bees that is fundamentally different than saying it was made by something not of this earth id has at its core the notion that something outside the system we can observe is at cause here this is not science in any sense of the word it is mythology when name was having a wrestling match with babe his blue ox they kicked up so much dirt they created the great lakes no evidence of name and his ox remain i mean really second natural science takes an approach to knowledge that nothing is known scientific law unless it is irrefutable theories must have heavy supporting empirical data to back it up id turns this on its head and does an end run around knowledge and plays games with probabilities if no one can say how flagella on bacteria could have formed naturally how in the hell can id proponents come up with any sort of mathematically accurate probability of flagella naturally forming on bacteria if you dont understand it you cant do statistics on it id jumps right over that hurdle and takes anything that doesnt have a complete detailed natural explanation and jams in their own statistics that say well its so improbable for this to happen that someone must have designed it this is such a perversion of science you can assign probabilities to something you dont understand id is just making up their numbers finally your example has ab where b was deliberate design thats all well and good for a rigged example except that with respect to life on earth b is unknown your ab example might qualify as forensic science if a were a dead body and b were a bullet in the heart you see a bunch of dead bodies with bullets through the heart the next time you see a body with a bullet through the heart you can probably figure thats what killed him you dont have that with life on earth you have one scenario a and you have no other cases to observe or test so in that sense ab is not scientific if youve never actually observed b btw b is teh intelligent designer which has never been observed so in that sense no it isnt science,0
why your article got jumped on hi im sorry to jump on your contribution the moment you put it in but the trouble is it is simply not the sort of thing wikipedia is for these links are all in one or other of the template notices above but to put them all in one place the reasons your article is being nominated for deletion are wikipedia is not a dictionary articles on neologisms need strong evidence that the term is widely used wikipedia is not for things made up one day more advice on contribtuing in the links from the welcome paragraph above the list of bad article ideas is worth looking at too regards,0

first off modern computergenerated ornate renderings of the paleohebrew yhuhyhwh and modern hebrew tetragrammaton were added in the article anyway mine were of anthropological resources my friend prof name university of phoenix anthropologist the w in yhwh was not intended to represent not of the yod as the ancestry but of the ancestry of roman w back to the aramaic u and then the paleo y the transliteration of the en vowel u whether a u vowel or vowel instead of vvor w consonant and the better pronunciation for example ability for pronunciation of the greek letter upsilon changed in soundvalue from a u vowel to an umlaut or frontrounded vowel was relevant to the tetragrammaton as far as the representation by many that there are no vowels in the tetragrammaton and third yahusha as in the same tetragrammaton of yahshua ref strongs concordance sha for deliverer and shua for scream or cry does existed in hebrew so is not completely bogus as a supposed historical divine name anonmoos talk,0

hello hi name glad to see you did not permanently leave wikipedia i was wondering why my templatecurrent event template redirect wasnt working couldnt see the obvious talk 36z thanks thanks for taking note of the arcata eye and plazoid pages happy birthday have a great day talk name that was really funny gave me a good chuckle you should have just crossed it out and left it in talk removing religious and political categories recent attempt at vote stacking leaves a bad taste in my mouth were you referring to this wikipediaadministrators noticeboardincidents alliance of wikipedialike vote stacking name no i was referring to a wikipedia email i recieved earlier today sent by now policy proposal hi you recently commented on bibleverse articles and may therefore be interested in commenting about a proposed policy covering roughly specific verses wikipediacentralized discussionverses of kings and name i noticed you changed the logo for the ubuntu linux user box why the usage policy on ubuntus offical site clearly allows for such use besides the logo is just that a lowresolution image of a logo which is allowed under fair use i am aware that some discussion has been going around about fair use images in user boxes if you changed the logo to tux because i labeled it as a fair use image and not with some other licensing information im sure i can find an appropriate image copyright tag at the time i had changed it several ongoing discussions had indicated that copyrighted images and logos available under fair use were not to be used in userspace per wikipedia policy the ubuntu trademark policy may allow it but wikipedia policy per wpfu is to limit images that are not available for commercial use which the ubuntu trademark policy explicity disallows talk contribs the preceding text was copied from user talkjcarroll wpnpa please review and adhere to wpnpa wpciv and wpwqt please refamilliarize yourself with wikipedia policy thanks in advance i am fully aware of the above policies thank you i do not feel that it can be considered a personal attack or incivil to call a troll a troll im sorry if you dont agree with me in that but that does not mean that my statement is a violation of any of the above policies talk contribs it is a violation and you must refrain from it wpnpa is nonnegotiable funny nobody considers it a violation of wpnpa to call userwilly on wheels a vandal nobody con,0
proper notation of pie phonemes people here are confused between how phonemes are represented in attested languages versus protolanguages while its true that for example a protosound like p is a phoneme and that it may be represented as p when pronounced as such its not true that these symbols are simply interchangeable with ipa notation the phoneme h2 cannot be represented in ipa notation as h2 whatsoever because h2 is not a valid ipa symbol depending on the theories of the ieist in question regarding the pronunciation of h2 however the sound may be represented as some universally recognized ipa symbol such as x for example a velar fricative mixing up these notations belies vast ignorance of the topic less editing more reading,0

replacement please do not edit below this note the whole suprasection will disappear again once i am able to post on the article talk page this includes you shell had you not blocked me i would have been able to place my answers there this will disappear tomorrow so you can put with it until then because shell falsely blocked me i cannot save my replies on a certain article talk page hence i will save the entire page minus the archived sections here pov concerns im surprised this article isnt being called antisemetic because its has a few traces of islamic perspectives in it you know as opposed to being a piece of zionist propaganda being passed off as fair and balanced this entire article is full of baseless jewish propaganda it is well documented the banu qurayza were executed for treason that is what merited them the death penalty that they commited treason the quarash and other tribes the muslims fought against were outright enemies who were persecuting them from the start but the qurayza signed a peace treaty then broke it by aiding the enemy this article contains soo much jewish propaganda that youd think they were executed for no reason which no doubt is their aim here is a great example look at this citation according to stillman name chose sad ibn muadh so as not to pronounce the judgment himself after the precedents he had set with the banu qaynuqa and the banu nadir name took the hint and condemned the adult males to death and the hapless women and children to slavery furthermore stillman infers from abu lubabas gesture that name had decided the fate of the qurayza even before their surrender this author is name a zionist jew who is very biased why is he being used as a quote in an islamic article and further more why is his baseless conjecture allowed to be used as if its a fact there are articles for criticisms of islam where the jews and others can write whatever they want but they should have no hand in editing islamic articles because i looked up the jewish articles and i noticed they dont allow dissent there you cant put a muslim perspective on evil acts commited by jews without it disappearing instantly so the same standard must be applied to islamic articles islamic articles must be written from the islamic point of view and the jews can write their responses in appropriate criticisms of islam articles if not i will personally edit the jewish articles and fill them with my conjectures about their history and i will find a nonjewish admin to arbitrate over the islamic articles good day please read this talk page specifically all of the places where treason or traitor is mentioned and if you still believe that we need to mention treason provide some reliable sources and we can discuss it it is easy for our article to be neutral and mention all povs but it does require that people like yourself participate we work from academic sources not personal conjecture changes by devotus and issues with them dear devotus i have still issues with your changes name and ramadan while i appreciate that you dont try you shift the balance removing a book from each side i do not agree with your removal name is an academic scholar and though her books are controversial she is not beyond the pale currently she doesnt serve as a reference in the article but if she did the controversy would be noted as for ramadan i have issues with him as well but if we remove him from the literature section we would have to remove him from the article too in which he serves as a reference this is due to the insistence of userbless sins he will certainly not like such a removal we cannot remove him from the literature section while retaining him in the article while your first version was needlessly verbose it is to be noted that the new one endorses that view by paretwatt the article now says that the bq were not killed for religious reasons that is not a fact since there is a good case that the whole conflict was caused by religious differences also we do not want to repeat things that have already been said in the coverage of the siege and demise eg the claim about attacking m in the rear also please abide by the one resolved conflict we fought hard and long about words like massacre and execution and neither should appear unless unavoidable the common practice thing is unacceptable as it is s,0

a tag has been placed on rubi coronado requesting that it be speedily deleted from wikipedia this has been done because the article seems to be about a person group of people band club company or web content but it does not indicate how or why the subject is notable that is why an article about that subject should be included in wikipedia under the criteria for speedy deletion articles that do not assert notability may be deleted at any time please see the guidelines for what is generally accepted as notable and if you can indicate why the subject of this article is notable you may contest the tagging to do this add on the top of the page below the existing db tag and leave a note on the articles talk page explaining your position please do not remove the speedy deletion tag yourself but dont hesitate to add information to the article that would confirm its subjects notability under the guidelines for guidelines on specific types of articles you may want to check out our criteria for biographies for web sites for bands or for companies feel free to leave a note on my talk page if you have any questions about this,0

hie name i was writing what follows while you made your edit i cant right now but i will coming to review in detail your example thanks johnuniq for your advice and input concerning the actual statement i had already thought that after clearing things up with name i would rephrase it into something in the lines of he is an iconic and inspirational reference for the generation growing up in the late 1970s early 1980s adding to some of the generation should clear your objection about the absence of stats but thats not the really important issue here the fact is that it is ethically improper from me and from wikipedia to declare that the you call it blog site is not a reliable source here but then find that the links and statements in inertia coupling or name are significant enriching contributions to the users of wikipedia and the sourced site is reliable there btw in these two and the few other topics the source is mentioned the statements leading to the source links would qualify as synthesis it would be highly objectionable from wikipedia to keep those links unchallenged for the time being and when someone gets around to rewriting the original material in the specific blog posts the links will be trashed out at this point the sentence being vague and inaccurate can be corrected it seems that if you articulate a sentence validated by some sort of source that is not a direct quote in most cases some synthesis is involved there is still the issue of the site being a reliable source it seems to me that the wikipedia efforts to keep the wackos with weird theories at bay is leading editors to substitute verifiability intelligibility and common sense by arguments of authority this would set me going into a long winded argument about what is happening to wikipedia once lauded as the place to come as you are becoming stiff purely factual and tight in such a way that it carries a lot of knowledge but no understanding this in turn carries into a discussion about public education and the work that name is known to the general public for cosmos was not about this marble statue said so but instead these are the reasons why we think so to me the posts in the disputed site i linked to are interesting but that maybe just my own personal opinion and wikipedia users having them available is positive constructive and enriching for wikipedia and thats the reason i linked to them in the first place throwing them out all of them seems like excluding a whole plethora of good things the baby with the bath water because a wikipedia directive says so just because it does not noticing the directives were written to prevent bad things from happening it would seem to me not to exclude good things by statute so the reliable source rules are something i would like to discuss a bit more at length,0
sorry i did not know,0
thb and vandal edits its been a tad more than twice see wikipediaadministrators noticeboardincidents conduct,0
i am looking at your edits with a certain amount of shock that you went ahead and made major adjustments while clearly in a state of confusion which you had not even worked out in your own mind but what is the problem you are grappling with all you need to do when reading these articles underhill sharma etc is read which mutations they tested what is so difficult about that,0
much content was dubiously changed and made what appeared to be changes to fundamental content of the article that appeared dubious to me that coupled with the lack of an informative edit summary i felt that the large scale changing of unsourced and unexplained content was possible vandalism because i was not sure i did not warn you and let you explain your edit talk contribs,0
please avoid entering disagreements which were started by vandals this user has a history of vandalizing references in articles it took another user to tell him to stop removing cited material from a page and using those links to float above his modification though those links didnt back up his statement this is the definition of a vandal if you read his talk history you will see disagreements with other users where he removes cited material to impose his own uncited views,0

name admits that he is a lying sob dear name admitted in front of dozens of reporters and in front of tv cameras last night february that he is not in fact an indian he has been lying about his heritage for many many years and people like me who live and work in indian country everyday have known for years that he was out and out lying about his heritage i repeat name during his speech at the university of hawaii admitted that he is not an indian the comment word for word was published in the honolulu starbulletin vol issue 54wednesday february name attacks essay s critics by name im going to attempt to be gracious but i have to say that you and missed the boat on this one im not going to do it tonight because i do need sleep but there is going to be huge rewrite of the article tomorrow because the article is just flat out wrong now these allegations of fabrications have been provable facts of fabrications it calls into questions so many other things about the guy what other things is he out and out lying about but more importantly the way that the section on his fake indian heritage needs to be completely rewritten considering the arrogant and sanctimous way that he has treated people like me in indian country who dared to question his indian heritage claims over the years i think that indian heritage section needs to play a more centralized role in the article and tomorrow that role is coming so many peoplewho do not even live in indian country who do not work in indian countrymade the claim that to dare question the great names fake indian heritage was a cheap shot we have been hearing that from nonindians for many many years and now name has admitted that he lied about it for over years he claims that it merely a misunderstanding created by some sloppy reporters that is a damn lie too he has been claiming indian heritage for over years it is written on either the front cover or back cover of his numerous books he refers to the fake indian scam in newspaper article after newspaper article he committed fraud when he applied to the university of colorado the denver post has published his employment application and on that application he claimed that he is indian for affirmation action purposes that is a damned lie there is going to be rewrite and name comments are going back in and all the rest your attempts to stifle the topic has ended by name himself feb utc,0

correction it will not be shut down the implementation allow to turn back selective signal aka turning off the high accuracy for non military users and that can be turn onoff anytime in any part of the globe selective iraq for example without affecting other parts of the system,0
so i hope you will oppose any version of name that would not have prevented this case as not being fit for purpose in just the same way that a retraction will be due from jimbo if he somehow comes up with a proposal that would not have prevented the name incident i hope that you might also realise that if in your words the case here is thankfully relatively rare why many people would then think that applying a blanket measure such as flagged revisions is not very appropriate at all i contrast it as the british government contending every citizen must be forced to carry an identity card on the presumption that is the best way you can catch terrorists which happen to also be thankfully relatively rare why not for example in this specific case take a more intelligent approach and implement sopmething that prevents or flags any edit that adds the word molesting instead of forcing onto all blp articles an incredibly blunt and incredibly bad faith assuming measure and any interested observers please stop before you say it these valid concerns with what name iscould be cannot all just be washed away by referring to the quite irrelevant advantage of name of opening up the tiny minority of protected articles and to further address the specific example you give maybe you can expand on why anybody would be likely to believe that one sentence claim when it was added to the article along with another sentences which at best hint at the whole thing being a hoax and at worst screams delete me now for being total wpbollocks we can also discuss how an editor in between the vandalism and your removal fixes the article for typos without noticing that it is complete bollocks even when one of the typos is a few words away from the molesting red flag a systemic failure perhaps and finally as an admin perhaps you can tell me why the ip user is not now blocked irrespective of how long ago the edit occurred incidentally the now famous bad account on name was also not blocked immmediately after his first edit was a blp violation on an unrelated article another systemic failure im all for criticla analysis of cases name would have prevented because they frequently pose more questions than they answer about the whole model of wikipedia never mind how we efficiently and intelligently prevent blp violations,0

to quote if a wikipedia article links to this page it is because someone is concerned that the article contains inaccurate statements such statements are followed by the following warnings dubious discuss the accuracy of a statement may be a cause for concern if it contains unlikely information without providing references it contains information which is particularly difficult to verify please do not remove my dubious reference edits as that would be against the guidelines there wouldnt it,0
did you even look at my edit before reverting it i did change it up as you wanted to say that name thinks it doesnt work and as you said it hits on many things that are also said elsewhere in the article making it perfect for the lead just because it is stated elsewhere in the article by other sources doesnt mean we can also use this source the more sources the better i would suggest we both stop touching the article until you come up with a clear reason why it shouldnt be added as i know all too well how this works no one touches it in order to finish this dispute and then the person who didnt want the information in the article will just stop discussing because they think they have won and then revert whenever the page gets changed,0

section needs to be edited this line about new hampshire is not very accurate on january for the first time name was officially observed in all states prior to that new hampshire and arizona did not observe the day in fact new hampshire passed civil rights day in to honor name and other civil rights activists like name and name the article states clearly that other states such as utah have different names for the holiday including combining it with confederate military heroes this sentence does not seem justifiable the article leaves the impression that new hampshire was some sort of bigoted state that was one of the last to recognize this holiday i am a newbie to wikipedia how do we fix this,0
the statement drawn from watchtower literature honestly not clandescently not with hypocrisy is drawn from watchtower literature via name arguments and literature and imposed into the wikipedia article its too much of a coincidence that a more or less follower of name is going to come up with a reference to wa literature on his own exactly the same connection name makes without having first seen the connection made in name literature natural nature,0
can someone explain criticism to me this is taken from the criticisms section of the article since logic is inherently constant and that some things are more true than others it means that strong relativism cannot hold true under many conditions relativism often ignores how views have different weight to another an example of a similar phenomenon is the gay marriage debate in the us an example where the majority dictates the rights of the entirety even when it doesnt apply to them as they do not weigh up the effects of their views can someone explain what exactly this means i do not follow the first half of the paragraph the one that actually pertains to relativism and the example reads as complete nonsense to me especially this part the majority dictates the rights of the entirety even when it doesnt apply to them as they do not weigh up the effects of their views i do not think that a the majority in question believes that it doesnt apply to them though im not sure what it is in this context so the sentence may be true the majority believes that allowing gay marriage would undermine the moral standards of their society which of course applies to everybody in that society b the majority in question does not weigh up the effects of its views its views are that gay marriage should not be allowed for the benefit of society it is aware of the effects and does not object to them,0

youre kidding right you think every reference in wikipedia needs to be a web based source so you can check it from wpcite the citation should state as clearly fully and precisely as possible how a reader can find the source material such as by external link to the source website if the material is not findable online it should be findable in reputable libraries archives or collections if a citation without an external link is challenged as unfindable any of the following is sufficient to show the material to be reasonably findable though not necessarily reliable providing an isbn or oclc number linking to an established wikipedia article about the source the work its author or its publisher or directly quoting the material on the talk page briefly and in context,0

4meter4s sigh and my concerns only because mr 4meter4 had reverted any of contributions of mine given to this article so far i did not have a single chance to develop it his article called falsetto is not about falsetto it may be about his arrogance who knows there are a huge contraries regarding only the definition of falsetto there are many signs of entirely different falsetto compare those info which mr 4meter4 such anxiously protects in england italy or spain 16th century were described entirely different types of falsettos on the top of it mr 4meter4 perhaps never heard name singing falsetto or the falsetto of name singing of king diamond is based on falsetto what about name is it not falsetto mariah name or name do did not sing falsetto does any of these falsettos sound breathy not to me isnt out there published a note about those maybe only because 4meter4 does not look for it why it would not fit to his article he would have to admit that his only source vennard was probably having in the chair something else than falsetto or he was drunk 4meter4 quickly opened two or three books and things he had swallowed the world the whole physiology of his only falsetto is based on encyclopedia well perhaps it is enough for wikipedia or himself but not for me no there is much more out there only regarding physiology much much more and just because you allow idiots like 4meter4 to name the people the readers of wikipedia will read shit where are any proves of the research regarding female falsetto at 60ies mr know everything feel free to block me again i have no desire to write here any more,0

summary of the name debate negative votes delete the original editor was userivygohnair so it was marked as a vanity article for violating wpauto mapetite526 strong delete ignorance of the rules is not a valid argument for keeping an article vyse neutral positive votes procedural nomination name was applied but was contested and this warrants a further look im neutral for now even though this article doesnt seem to be colourburst commentquestioncsd a7 is unremarkable people groups companies and websites is that the reason for the name too according to wikipediavanityguidelines as explained below an authors conflict of interest by itself is not a basis for deletion but lack of assertion of notability is name it is true that i have come into the fray to defend ivy goh nair from speedy deletion and that her last page was actually uploaded by me i think if you want to apply the vanity label because one person edits the other and vice versa it would only be fair to examine each case on its own merit both userivygohnair and userchandrannair are established figures in the field that is being discussed ie singapore literature and writing secondly it should be considered in their favour that they have used their own names and not fictitious names as user names if this had been the case the problem wouldnt have arisen therefore i think there is much merit in user name remarks above and that an authors conflict of interest is by itself not a basis for deletion out by wikipedia chandrannair talk contribs comment lets be nice to newcomers as per wikipediaplease do not bite the newcomers this seems like a case where newcomers not knowing the rules here an author of bestseller may be notable enough to get an article in an encyclopedia perhaps this biography needs some fixing as per wikipediabiographies of living persons deleting is probably unnecessary pfhlai i have read her book though im not from singapore and its better than a lot of the stuff that makes it to the ny times best seller list the preceding unsigned comment was added by talk contribs new to all this in wikipedia i think the mood to delete is harsh this is a user who seems to have made a definite impact in a small place and is trying to popularise the creative energies of singapore let us be more forgiving besides it looks there is actual published reviews as testament to the work mcporpington mcporpington sorry i meant to add to my comment above that the article should not be deleted mcporpington mcporpington hi i am saddened to read such biting petty comments and suggestions about deleting this article this person has clearly contributed to singapore literature and has also been cited by others signed phillygal27 i did my military service in singapore and i love the country i vote to keep i do not see any conflict of interest herejeanlouis77 retrieved from,0

hi i like the diagram but i believe that the terminal station should be in normal text because it is where the train is ultimately heading toward similarly the next stop should be in small text because it is just a station on the wayside on the trains journey toward the last stop except in the penultimate stations of each line where the word terminus shows that the next stop is the terminus in the layouts that were originally written for the taipei metro and guangzhou metro the terminal was placed before the next stop so i had based the nycarea railroad layouts on the taipeiguangzhou layouts,0

i have been observing this dispute for some time and i must admit until now only because it amused me name i believe the problem here is that you started by advocating that user be given a break and then repeatedly told him that as a result of his efforts i believe this strategy will result in you getting blocked for being a dick i know you were probably trying to avoid making a personal judgment yourself but by not making your views clear on this ie i personally dont believe you are a dick or i believe this would be the right thing to do you made your views clear by omission its really hard to blame user for suddenly being upset with you did not the name say when they meet a sorrowful man they should lament the bitterness of this everchanging world user is clearly confused and sorrowful about name and was hoping for more of a constant in his advocate you have to admit whatever you think of his approach the ethnicity section does read a lot better because of his efforts peace,0
more on name writers many errors have been corrected in namepedias roman salute article the article had many visits from dr name in the past see its talk page as dr name attempted to correct the many errors however the wikipedia article on the roman salute is becoming more dishonest by the week an earlier version referenced the work of professor rex name and started thusly the roman salute is a gesture in which the arm is held out forward straight with palms down sometimes the arm is raised upward at an angle sometimes it is held out parallel to the ground the salute was supposed to have been used in the roman republic but there is no clear evidence of this indeed it is not known whether salutes in the military sense existed at all in roman culture by name a more recent version of the same article is written as if a neonazi has been coveringup again a big initial problem is that no wiki writer will even attempt to discover the first use of the phrase roman salute and thus the writers remain stuck in intellectually dishonest confusion about dates and origins the article reverts back to its earlier opening concessions to the work of dr name conceding that there is no clear evidence of the salute in the roman republic and also conceding that there is no evidence of salutes in the military sense at all in roman culture the wiki writer then engages in speculation that people today misunderstood some images from ancient rome there is no support for the idea that the roman salute concept arose long ago from misinterpretations of roman images there is as much evidence that after dr names shocking discoveries about the salutes origin with the pledge of allegiance modern writers including wiki writers deliberately looked for other explanations and then those writers misinterpreted roman images in order to coverup and suppress professor names discoveries the wiki writer then engages in speculation that neoclassical artists misunderstood some images from ancient rome there is no support for the idea that the roman salute concept arose among neoclassical artists from misinterpretations of roman images there is as much evidence that after dr names shocking discoveries about the salutes origin with the pledge of allegiance modern writers including wiki writers deliberately looked for other explanations and then those writers seized upon neoclassical artists in order to coverup and suppress professor names discoveries for example there is no evidence that name actually thought that his painting the oath of the horatii represented an actual historical roman salute all of the evidence indicates that name created the scene out of whole cloth for drama all of the speculating otherwise is actually the machinations of wiki writers and people of their ilk the intellectual dishonesty is all the more evident in that the wiki writers deliberately faill to address those very points already made by dr name further the horatii painting depicts three people reaching for weapons the tennis court oath was painted by name later and repeats names use of the dramatic gesture that name concocted but in a more modern setting there is no evidence that it accurately depicts the event protrayed name was not there further the oath was was written on paper the paper being read by the central figure and the oath was taken by signing the document there is no evidence that anyone is taking an oath in the painting the central figure might be swearing or he might be reading his document while those people about him waive hats talk holler point etc three figures on the left seem to be an inside reference to the horatii painting the wiki writer is misrepresenting the works or reading into them the distribution of the eagle standards was painted by name even later and repeats names use of the dramatic gesture that name concocted but in another modern setting there is no evidence that it accurately depicts the event protrayed and there is no evidence that anyone is taking an oath in the painting at all the wiki writer claims that this is the mos important of these paintings that painting shows no use of the salute in pledging or oathtaking or at all and simply shows various people with various gestures acclaiming the central figure and grabbing for and shouting for the eagle standards the wiki writer is misrepresenting the works and reading into them the wiki writer then claims that other painters during the nineteenth century regularly depicted the straightarm g,0

to view the details on the name site click the above link and click about name in the bottom right corner since name is a danish store i assume that the numbers on the danish page are the most updated and that the other country pages are translated from it talk arson the name store was destroyed by arson as well in about of course before it burnt down baked beans were 7p after it burnt down they went up to 10p because they were cooked lol is that a joke or is it serious if joking its funny it is true that the name store burned down it moved out to crossflatts while it was being rebuilt the bean prices though were just a joke that were being passed around at the time request for info review ive just had a look at this selection and i dont think it should belong in this article this is the section the cause has not yet been identified but it is believed to have been started by a faulty heater the fire broke out at around 4am and firefighters from around the area were called to battle the flames the fire was not completely put out until about 12pm it is not yet known whether the building will be demolished and rebuilt name is famously associated with good value but there is a definite negative connotation linked to the supermarket chain associated with cheapness being mainly a food shop for the lower working class it is becoming very popular with schoolchildren who often claim that a fellow classmate shops there as to insult the receiver due to name being known for its cheapness my view is that it is unescessary information and the negative connotation section is an indirect attack at name i personally have never got that impression myself or heard those connotations and they do not need to be in this article surely the schoolchild quote is again not needed in the article this is an encyclopedia not a local news paper please let me know your views because i am tempted to remove it no responses so i gather we are in agreement if not please post a comment on my discussion page thanks,0

new louisville definition since the census bureau has clearly defined the new louisville as only the old city and unincorporated areas i think there some details needed that need to be added defining metro government first it is important to note that a ky legislative bill dubbed the lyndon bill prohibits suburban cities from annexing more land if this were not the case then the unincorp areas could create their own government and only the old city would again be left second this definition wont effect the new citys population growth since nearly all growth is in the unicorpirated areas and nearly all suburban cities are having very slow growth or even populatiuon losses third even if suburban cities dont count toward the population their residents can still vote for metro mayor and council members and will still receive metrowide help in such areas as urban planning and emergency services personally i think the official municipality the entire county is what should make up this article regardless of what the census bureau says the smaller article with the balance is what should have the information for the censusdefined city your ideas of what the census bureau has defined are not correct what you are referring to is the louisvillejefferson county balance which is not the same thing as consolidated louisvillejefferson county both are defined separately by the census bureau see here this article is about the consolidated louisvillejefferson county which is how the city is legally incorporated the confusion lies in the census bureaus use of balance figures when ranking cities rather than the consolidated figures although even this use is inconsistant as they seem to use the full consolidated figures for the decennial rankings the census bureau has accepted the louisville jefferson balance but not the citycounty consolidation which is why the suburban populations are not counted in its estimates and wont be in future censuses because of the acceptence of the loujef balance my points should be brought up about the ban on suburban city annexation if this were not the case then the balance could be quickly eaten up by the suburbs your assertion is not entirely correct the census bureau does in fact include the entire consolidated louisvillejefferson county in their estimates they also include a separate figure for the balance louisvillejefferson countykentuckya louisvillejefferson county balancekentuckya thats from the estimates the last number is the estimated population this article is not about the balance however issues involving the balance should be discussed on the balance articles talk page actual population there are too many disputes about the population of the actual city proper according to the census bureau estimates the balance population is and not anywhere near what is the actual city proper population as that is to be what is listed i do not believe that louisville has a population anywhere near that of columbus ohio we need to decide the official population of the city proper and correct any and all inaccurate statements regarding the actual population there are several pages in wikipedia listing the population as or so when the census lists the population as i understand that several people especially those who live in the area want the population figure to be high so the city can reach a higher status if it was a city i lived in i would like to do the same however that cannot be done here an actual correct population for the city proper and the metro needs to be listed if we are able to we need to come up with the balance population of the counties and the actual city i am a little confused myself and i did not want to attempt to change anything before it is discussed there have been many people who have debated this over and over again and we have come to the consensus that is now demonstrated in the article please for the sake of your own knowledge read all the talk archives that cover this situation since there is a consensus thats currently overwhelmingly not in your favor you might want to do that research before thinking about flaming things up userstevietheman,0

unblock request fuck you unblock me unblockhahaahahahahahahaha unblock me or i will vandalise more it had been six years since we had graduated from college and for the first time since graduation all three of us were together again from the enthusiastic hugs at the airport and then the conversation and laughter during the dinner we shared at a local restaurant on the way to my home it was clear that while plenty of time had passed and we had kept in contact the comfort and attraction between the three of us when all together in the same physical location was still undeniable having returned to my cozy semisecluded home in the suburbs we all sat in the living room sipping wine and continuing the tales of our lives with the exceptions of the location a house and the presence of alcohol it could have been any of our final two years of college together the three of us tightknit friendswithbenefits sitting and chatting and sharing a drink together then name and name had been roommates while i lived in another dorm across the main quad now they were muchwelcomed guests who had fortunately been able to clear time in their hectic schedules to come and visit me for a weekend as i sat in the recliner and took another sip of wine i allowed my eyes to truly linger on name as she told name about a recent situation at work the florida sun had certainly added a glow to names skin and may have also been responsible for the lighter shade of her shoulderlength brown hair as when we were in college together she wore virtually no makeup just a thin gloss upon her lips an enticing strawberry flavor as i had discovered upon meeting her at the airport earlier in the evening and red fingernails her red dress was indeed elegant with a plunging sequined neckline that permitted a very welcome display of her cleavage a display which name and i both certainly appreciated the long slit up the skirt of the dress revealed that she was wearing stockings held up by a garter belt one of its descending white straps definitely noticeable against the welltoned thigh the red heels provided enough of a contrast for the white stockings to truly attract the eyes surprisingly however she wore hoop earrings something she had never worn during college for fear that they would pull at her ears and widen the piercing holes more than was considered safe the conversation turned back toward me but a few minutes later the two beautiful young women were again chatting primarily to each other i took the opportunity to once again study name and was equally impressed while noticeably shorter than name name was also paler in complexion a testament to living in northern canada ever since graduation and spending virtually every waking moment inside to conduct her research as in college name preferred the color black for her outfits a somewhattight sweater formfitting slacks and a pair of low heels four tiny earrings adorned each ear plus she bore a small sparkling stud against her left nostril names black hair flowed over her shoulders and down her front and she absently twirled several strands around a finger as she listened to name it felt so good to be in their presence once again especially since all three of us had been in several failed relationships since graduating from college i was thankful that i had thought to invite them to spend the weekend with me i had absolutely no doubt that our chatter would eventually give way to intimacy but for now i was quite content to simply sit back in the recliner and openly admire the two stunning beauties perched upon the sofa the intimacy began when we finally went to bed together i was on my back under the covers with a very feminine head resting softly upon each shoulder an arm wrapped around each of them i held the two women close to me as they absently stroked my bare chest dipped a finger into my navel brushed my thighs through the sweatpants i typically wore to bed caressed my stiffening manhood my eyes closed i reveled in their touches inherently familiar yet full of rediscovery due to the lengthy passage of time no words were needed and as their hands occasionally made contact with each other upon me i smiled to myself in the darkness having always enjoyed watching name and name in their own intimate encounters but eventually their touches slowed and ultimately ceased their breathing falling into the regularity associated with sleep i stayed awake a little longer immensely enjoying the closeness with two of the people who had been most important in my life i awoke in the morning to the scent of french roast coffee faint yet unmistakable name was gone clearly the one who had brewed the morning nectar while name and i held each other as sh,1

well i am not trying to pick a fight but i have npov issues with this article it reads at the moment like a celebration of scientific progress i have two problems first it moves too easily from science as a generic activity all people engage in to science as a specifically western project second although there has been progress in science in that there is some accumulation of knowledge the history of science is rather more complicated than that one way to deal with this if others find my criticisms valid is to distinguish in the article between what we know about changes in scientific method and knowledge from aristotle to bacon to comte to popper from aristotle to name to name to name from aristotle to newton to einstein and planck etc on the one hand and various discussions over how to study and conceive of the history of science ie issues in historiography and the sociology of science on the other for example i think everyone agrees that aristotle newton einstein and planck are real people who lived at different periods of time and made different claims about the world but i think different people have vastly different ways of telling the story that connects these people and their claims id hope a good article on the history of science would inform me of these issues and provide me with the different ways of understanding the movement from one period in science to another i am no expert on this but i really hope someone who feels very confident of their grasp of say name and name could reorganize and develop this article in a way that takes their claims about science seriously as well as the claims of those with opposing views i am glad name has begun this article it can be really important and it is a needed contribution sr,0
its right and certain that the benefits have been proposed and self evident from any reference that have proposed them there also does not exist any reliable refutation of any of the list of proposed benefits the standard for inclusion as proposed benefits is or should be that they are debatable there is no evidence that they are implausible and the points are clearly argued it is the most critical section of the entire article after all and has been up on the page for about year for the scrutiny of the entire community its likely that any feeling you may have that the information is wrong is misguided and if you expressed those feelings youd have an opportunity to learn from the community why those feelings may be in a weaker debating position than some of the proposed benefits,0

s rant presently we are witnessing an open war against name culture croatian left often portrays this culture as primitive and rural even fashist being in service of conservative hdz party croatian writer name for instance performed on gusle instrument in zagreb on several occasions this year with only one intention to ridicule the same instrument and its rich poetic tradition another apostle of croatian left miljenko jergovi refers to his political opponents on the right as gusle players some even claim the serbian origin of name culture following the line of traditional greater serbian propagabda all tokavian people and their culture are serbian however name folklore and its rich gusle heritage is primarly croatian name costal region has been historically associated with this culture for example the first written document about the most popular folk hero of traditional gusle music name is associated with name island name through petar hektorovi s book name i ribarsko prigovaranje also the first historical document which mentioned gusle player and its instrument originated in name even now a contemporary croatian writer born in name stijepo name tells us a story about his uncle also from name area who could memorize numerous gusle songs stijepo name name name may p name is also a home of name born name a daughter of famous gusle player name although illiterate she was able to recite by heart an immense number of gusle songs some of which were recorded in antology of croatian folk poetry not far from name another coastal city name was also a bastion of croatian gusle music actually this region could be considered the capital of all croatian gusle players this mediterranean area also gave birth to name 18th century catholic priest who is viewed as the father of all gusle players of croatia and beyond to honour names work name the most famous croatian sculptor built a sculpture in america showing name in his priestly clothes playing gusle instrument in addition to name name littoral produced a great many other followers of croatian gusle music according to dr fra name who quotes the work of croatian folklorist name zaostrog alone produced a great number of gusle players starting with name and culminating with the most known name trli as for name women they didnt play gusle its considered a male activity only yet they were actively involved in spreading gusle music by imitating its sound name the researcher of name folk poetry in the 1960s states in his book ljuba ivanova that most of his name folk poetry collection was obtained by women especially the ones from the island of name the zadar littoral also witnessed strong gusle tradition english writer name travelling through zadar region in the first decade of 20th century states in her book dalmatia the land where east meets west that the gusle was the national instrument of the region as for name dances which took place at markets and certain festivals they are very picturesque and interesting and worth going a long way to see being a survival of ancient custom probably unique in europe p this admiration for name folk music particularly gusle was seen in both name litteral and hinterland name the researcher of this literarymusic forms had reported that during his trips through dalmatia in the 1930s he saw a child barely three years old playing gusle name hrvatske narodne juna ke pjesme name p now lets take a look at the names of some name sports clubs and organizations hajduk junak gusar name uskok sinjska alka etc what do they have in common of course their names refer to the heroic gusle tradition of the region having this in mind one wonders why this proud croatian heritage has become almost extinct why do we have so few gusle players today is it a result of unavoidable urbanization of modern croatian society where peasant culture is being considered inferior to global rock n roll culture if so why has tamburitza music of northern croatia gained wide acceptance from the croatian establishment while its name counterpart gusle music is looked upon with suspicion and open hatre,0

bagration attribution hello i have reverted your edit to operation bagration again the point is not whether zaloga got his numbers from name or not which doesnt seem to be the case given the large discrepancy in the numbers the point is you cannot attribute a claim to a particular author and then cite the claim to another if you attribute a claim to one author you must cite the appropriate work by that author if you want to include names figures then add a sentence along the lines of g f name however places the soviet losses much higher at killed moreover you cant just remove a valid source because you think its wrong all information by reliable historians should be cited especially if there is disagreement on a particular issue which appears to be the case here,0
european borders there is a big problem going on about whether republic of georgia and other neighboring countries should be included in europe or not as you know there is no official border between europe and asia and there is a great number of unofficial versions so you might think that it is logical to explain all of the versions that exist for today on that page well sadly thats not what most editors think they put one version there and every time i changed it it went back to the previous version now i am just wondering do these people think it is their personal page or what gives them the right to rely on several sources and ignore other ones that are not any less trust me they should definately offer every version of where the border goes between the two continents instead of putting only one version and not even bothering to explain why it is unacceptable i contacted one of the editors and heshe said that he chose that version because heshe thinks it is the most neutral one i am sorry but what some users think should be completely irrelevant while making an article on the website which has an ambition to be credible they should include all of the versions or not include anything at all before there is an official border council of europe the oldest organization in europe classifies country as european country is in the middle of the nato membership process only european countries are eligible for it according to the north atlantic treaty and they are not even mentioning why they left it out turkey is not the case because it was already amember of nato cant they understand that page is not about the eu its the entire europe as a whole and until the borders will be determined officially all of the versions should be included i really want to ask someone to take care of it as they dont seem to understand my very logical argument and even used some rude words in private messages,0

records of awesome editors who truly want to help as this is not a study of peoples hesitancy it is not a suitable source for claims about the reasons for peoples hesitancy it would appear to be at best a study making claims about vaccines themselves not a study about hesitancy or about controversy if this study is the reason for peoples hesitancy then we should be pointing to a reliable thirdparty source that states that its the reason not to the study itself if we say people stopped going to the beach because of the film name we use as a reference the source that makes that statement not the film itself so no its not a reliable source for what you claim you want to use it for name talk that has got to be the clearest explanation yet so what you are saying is cite a source that says there is controversy over the vaccine schedule because there is a correlation with infant mortality then cite both sources or should i use opinion pieces like most of the other references in the article even the journal of medicine piece is an opinion piece is this where wiki gets the facts from opinions then excludes peer reviewed journal articles because it is wpor it is built by popular opinion of the editors from opinion pieces not allowing factsif this is indeed truethough i hope notdcrsmama talk no im not saying cite both sources references are there to verify the facts that are being stated in wikipedias voice if the statement being sourced is that there is a controversy due to correlation with infant mortality then we cite a source that is discussing the controversy there is no need to cite the study even if the source says that there is a controversy because of this particular study we might mention this study in the text but the study itself is not reference for the statement and i am addressing the specific request for input that you made in your initial posting if you have concerns about the other sources in the article you may wish to raise them in a specific post about the specific concerns name talk from wprps,0

north korea actually gained approximately name from china in the treaty and heres a 19th century book by name titled koreas northern border reigion in a korean sourcebook compilation translated by name a long time ago the area north of the tumen river was the land of the sushen people it has not been under our control since the time of the three han the southern slopes of mount changbaek where both the tumen and yalu rivers have their headwaters lay within our territory but the winding ridges and layers of peaks make the exact location of the border unclear however emperor name in the final years of his reign ordered area commander name name tsungkuan name to delineate the border and erect a stone boundary marker as a result the border between those two rivers is clear as well emphasis mine heres another study of the usnorth korea border in by the us dept of state which makes no mention of north korea owning the entire mountain and another which says that china actually made concessions to nk on the border in the only sources that seem to claim that korea once owned the entire place are some recent tabloid news articles that protest china conducting activities on its own side of the border and of course a few ultranationalist sites but please enlighten me if you can provide other reliable sources as well on another rather amusing note it does seem my userboxes are being quite effective experiment in showing which users are capable of judging others by the content their edits and which prefer to judge a book by its cover and lash out emotionally should be made in a new section on the talk page no further edits should be made to this section the result of the debate was no move requested move chonji tianchi the name was unilaterally moved from tianchi to chonji without concensus for pov reasons cited in move and talk page such as that it should be korean its on the border between china and korea another reason cited was that the name of the baekdu mountain page is korean as well however a google search shows nearly hits for tianchi and and less than each for chonji and cheonji thats two orders of magnitude in difference the preceding was quoted by yuje survey add support or oppose followed by a brief explanation then sign your opinion with support for the most common name searches for chonji for all the most popular search engines combined give less than a thousand hits search on google scholar shows only uses of the name chonji for the lake the use of chonji as a clear common name doesnt apply because its not common support per yuje naming conventions gives preference to the more popular name oppose per visviva and my previous comments like i said before we need to use the most common name that is the clearest because tianchi is a name for many other places in china as shown chonji is nowhere near common chonji barely shows up any hits therefore isnt a viable alternative for a clear alternative name name at my reason below comment the proposition seems to be flawed given that tianchi is now an article on the lake in urumqi if this article is moved it would need to go somewhere else perhaps tianchi changbaishan or even heh heh tianchi paektusan but then again maybe tianchi jilin if we must have a straw poll it would be helpful to know what the full suggested title is comment the issue you brought up is a legitimate one and shouldnt be ignored thus perhaps tianchi could be a disambiguation page or this page could be moved back to the original and there could be a tianchi disambiguation page either one is a reasonable alterna,0

any reason why as we dont want vandalism on the main page so that is why its protected theres not much to change anyway since its split into articles in a different area talk and the fact that it is automatically updated per transcluded pages and variables wikipediafeatured articlecurrentmonthname currentday currentyear trip shh its obviously a vandal trying to learn how to vandalise the main page feed them disinformation the page is cascadingly if thats even a word protected so if he or she is a vandal there is no way that he or she could vandalize pages transcluded onto the main page trip you have to type in the superpassword into the searchbox which name gives to his most trusted users then you get a big red button that says are you sure you want to edit the main page if you click it you can edit it but only you because it reads the users ip address once you make the edit it takes effect but it isnt recorded in history and can only be seen in a special log which is only accessable using the superpassword thats why they say things like currentmonth currentyear etc to fool new users name talk pedantically misinformation is different from disinformation fixed thank you talk dont listen to ao the correct way to edit the main page is simple to edit the main page you need to follow these steps take off all your clothes get a friend parent or whatever to take a photo of you editing wikipedia naked this photo must be at least 1500x1000 pixels editing the page naked will extend your editing capability by minutes but any other page is fine upload said found to the wikimedia commons under a license of you choice go to the sandbox and put your photo there repeat the above step times when the photo gets changed once youve done this come back and click on view source you will see a message on your screen for about second it will give you the name of a page you must edit if you productively edit this page within seconds you will now be able to edit the main page if you miss either of this you will have to start all over again from step one including a new photo be aware that if at any time you vandalise wikipedia or try to pass off a photo of someone else as you you will be banned from editing the main page for life x good luck hmm i know this discussion is cold but wouldnt it be awesome if the welcome to wikipedia box said everyone can edit even this very page or click here to edit this very page this would really reinforce the idea of wikipedias editability maybe somehow protect the current content of the page and add a box containing edits at the bottom i realise noone would ever agree to this the chances of vandalism profanity etc being posted there are but it would be pretty cool wouldnt it goldfritter april,0

unfortunately eyrian does not seem to realize that wikipedia is a unique encyclopedia that greatly differs from other online encyclopedias in that anyone can contribute to wikipedia and everyone is a volunteer the only reason other encyclopedias arent as large as wikipedia is because they dont have enough resources to make it as large and they only want hired professionals writing their articles,0
if you really beleive all that shia crap then good luck to you cuz youre gonna need it in life you dont seem to have a solid grip on reality you seem to live in your own world anyhow i will give you a bit of clue free of charge the reason there are some favourable names for iranians is surprise surprise because out of the main name authors were iranians including the most authoritative ones name name and name name was also iranian the first were name and name was from pars the other name authors are not as major and their works are basically a copyandpaste from the name of the iranian authors name was from neyshapour but claimed to be of qushayri origin so that he was better accepted as some real arab from an authentic arabic origin but there is academic information that he was indeed of khorasani origin and his claim of alqushayri roots is unverifiable the most authoritative of the names is alname from the city of bukhara having read what you wrote for me i have reason to believe that someone like you is out of touch with reality and i am not even going to accept an edit war with someone like you so i let you be happy by deleting the forced out of the article and stay happy with your romanticism and keep thinking that shahrbanoo indeed chose name and they lived happily ever after and both name and name knew persian and shahrbanoo realized that they had special knowledge hehe no wonder your nation is the way it is today their educated people are like you i can imagine what the uneducated ones are like feb utc,0

names doesnt represent any subtotal contrary to eu gdp in your example it is rather arbitrary mix of athletes from different countries the current medal table serves the sole purpose of noc comparison and names introduces some confusion into this comparison look it is definitely listed for comparison here taking its place according to its medal count even without rank assigned why not to show another medal table to the right of the current medal table and this second table would contain medals of different nocs won by athletes within mixednoc teams name competitions shouldnt be considered somewhat less relevant so this table is also a relevant one it is separated just because theres no valid reason to combine them together within noc medal table since it would compromise the purpose of noc comparison,0

im in twothree minds over this proposal as regards redlinks on the one hand over the last two years of monitoring the topic ive seen it used as a catalyst and incubator for new articles on the other hand it is arguable that a death reported in a wprs is of a person of some note if not necessarily within our standards on the third hand we do get some nohopers on the face of it which is why we tend to allow a month for an interested editor to create an article and then delete undeveloped entries as nonnotable in the second case we perhaps should not interpret lack of interest as lack of notability because it may be that interested editors are lacking thats why the month moratorium seems to exist as far as i can tell andemu,0

there are many inaccurate statements being posted here far too many i dont have time to correct all of them the bnp was modernised by name and has no links to holocaust denial or nazism digging up or year old quotes is irrelevant you can do that for all parties as many change their ideology the modern labour party are not the traditional labour party just how the conservative party are no longer traditional conservative tories during the heydey of the british empire the conservatives were proimperialistic and supported the colonisation of other countries do you think the modern conservatives under cameron support that another example the green party in uk used to strongly oppose drugs yet now they support druguse and want to ban the prohibition of drugs and support the possession trade and cultivation of cannabis so they went from being antidrug to prodrug the modern bnp has no links to holocaust denial secondly the comment about name and the raf bombings is a typical distortion of what he said by antibnpers what name actually said is that the raf should not have bombed german innocents children and woman as many were murdered in the bombing of dresden likewise he also opposed the bombing of innocent british civilians by the nazis also the last claim modern bnp members name i presume was a comical claim it has no basis in fact bnp are strongly against nazism and fascism if you want a real fascist organisation that would be the uaf unite against freedom who attack bnp members with clawhammers and other weapons etc is that democratic you might not like someone elses political views but that doesnt give you a right to go out and attack them violently,0

to cool hand luke i ask for your help as an administrator with this problem from the wikipedia deletion guidelines deletion process main article wikipediadeletion policy deletion of articles from wikipedia occurs through one of three processes another quick method is the use of proposed deletion simply add to the top of the article this is meant for articles where the deletion is believed to be uncontroversial yet does not meet the criteria for speedy deletion a proposed deletion can be contested by any user by removing the tag within five days and if anyone still wants the article deleted the full afd process is required i thought i complied with this policy it seems to say that any user can contest the proposal by removing the tag it seems obvious that this article easily meets the criteria for notabilitythe stated reason for deletion beyond meeting the criterias specifics the criteria also has a catchall inclusion rule that the mere fact that an article does not meet specific criteria is not a sufficient reason to delete it i believe that the proposal to delete this article was made in retaliation against me personally and was not made in good faith to further the goals of wikipedia and that the proposal to delete along with the reasons given which i believe are not in good faith therefore violates various wikipedia policies the evidence for this belief includes the proximity in time to an unrelated disagreement with the user proposing deletion the users prior lack of interest or contribution or current knowledge of as demonstrated by his reasons or comments to the subject of the article proposed for deletion the fact that i have worked on this article in the past the fact that this user on or about the same day and time in close proximity to the unrelated dispute with me proposed two other articles that i have worked on that the user also has not previously or currently demonstrated any knowledge of or interest in proposed such articles for speedy deletion and then before i or anyone else had a chance to object wikipedia is not a full time job for most users who only visit the site from time to time and note also the stated policy that there are no emergencies on wikipedia the user decided not to wait for any objections or to follow the policy of allowing the stated time period to pass redirected the article to another article effectively deleting the original article in fact the redirect was effect as i was typing out an objection to the deletion with a reasoned explanation on why it should stay and when i hit save the article was gone and my objection and response are now lost he gave me three rapid succession warnings in bad faith for what i believe were good faith acts on my part and had me blocked before i could make a response to his warnings it appears that he has dome similar things in the past to other users it seems quite clear in light of the above and further facts that can be marshalled in support that this users intent is not supported by facts or policies not in good faith in retaliation and therefore in violation of wikipedia policy name this i communicated to this user that i would refrain from any activity that was the subject of the origial unrelated disagreement by not making any further comment on the talk page of tort reform i had hoped that this would resolve that dispute but it has not as the user had made the dispute personal as for my being blocked by you as per the revert rule i must point out that i do not believe the rule applies to what i did because i was making a good faith effort to resolve the dispute by asking the user to stop his vandalism and disruption the posts involved were all on his talk pagethe most appropriate place to discuss a users his apparent violations rather than reply he deleted the warnings and requests to stop did so more than three times in violation of the rule in bad faith turned the rule on mei did not delete anything and technically i did not revert anything either i think but was adding to previous posts and merely included the previously deleted material as support for a new post other indications of bad faith the user asserts that i committed vandalism to the entry on sonics rendezvous band by removing the delete tags my reply is i did so in accordance with policy it is not vandalism to remove,0

attributing and classifying of personalities invitation your input to culture of lithuania is welcomed some problems of defining personalities or attributing them to certain wellknown ideological systems may raise here i propose a quite liberal variant of it where definition may not be connected with one certain word necessity however to follow certain classifying remains my initial ideas on this branch the ones concerning period of name national renaissance period some artists writers or other cultural workers of this period are often described as modernists this definition is not false but some more concrete things should be added some specifics of lithuania we should distinguish leading ideas of the name renaissance from later modernism which is more known for us cultural aspirations of the later name ren may be defined as modernism in a cultural context of lithuania but they accented also expression of name cultural heritage and their expression may be seen as something simply typically name i mean that such authors in as iurlionis is seen as modernist in name context but it also and even more is a representative of name culture when in european or worldwide context a parallel example may be taken from literature of india poet tagore well known nobel price winner is known for us as a representative of culture of india making india more understandable and closer for western people is concerned as main his input to western culture but in his own country he was seen as a modernist too who was changing traditional cultural forms especially stagnated ones this way also name cultural leaders of the n ren could be seen as modernists which were broadening cultural forms and changing stagnated ones in name context they also can be seen as modernists in a wider context but more for acquainting western people with name culture than for their direct input into western culture iurlionis is the best example here in other way the later name modernists they depended mostly to later generation approximately from 4th decade of the 20th century concerned themselves part of western modernistic movement and their main purpose looking generally was to introduce western european ideas into name cultural life see the table below we see two different movements and two different world outlooks here the problem is that both movements collaborated especially their political wings did and interchange of ideas between them is well seen so many researchers dont pay attention to this difference especially in the soviet period when national ideas were officially forbidden mixture in description of these movements was allowed name name who clearly depends to the first generation is often described as liberal and it may be understood in a sense of the second generation as idea of liberalism period and generation artists writers philosophers etc in a context of lithuania in an european context the nameional renaissance period the younger generation approx painter and composer iurlionis painter name poet and philosopher name dramatist name poets adomas jak tas name name composer name philosopher name reformers and innovators of name culture representatives of name culture almost unknown before them the period between wwi and wwii and postwar years poets v mykolaitis putinas name writer ignas einius jurk nas artists all ars group philosopher name introducing new western ideas into name cultural life central european modernism note lists of personalities isnt complete here nor its made precisely by prominence jul utc,0

pws and pws pws pws hi halibutt excellent to see more polish aircraft articles but there seem to be some issues with these two the subject matter hardly warrants such detailed articles a single article to cover both would be sufficient as they were very closely related and differed mainly in size and engine arrangements ie merge them a variants section to explain the differences between the bn3 and t variants try to use your own prose instead of parrotting references avoid adding superfluous details such as the various competing aircraft which should only get fleeting mentions at best just some suggestions but if you look at the articles again objectively you may see my points good luck and carry on writing articles,0
decesed group members ive seen a few articles where band members have their name sollowed by deceased whats wrong witht that its just a little extra information for people who do not already know this surely this is the main reason such the articles exist in the first place or even why the whole wikipedia site exists whats so bad about adding this word after peoples names if they are no longer with us it is factual nonopinionative and does not slate them in anyway,0

with over college students studying abroad every year theres bound to be all kinds of tall tales urban legends and misinformation swirling around while there may be grains of truth in some of these stories below are some common misconceptions about study abroad misconception studying abroad is very expensive truth in most cases it is actually cheaper to study abroad lets say the tuition at your school is per semester and room and board is another now add in the additional fees you have such as health insurance books and laundry you are now well over for the semester well all but one of our programs in spain is under per semester and that includes everything except your airfare and spending money tab misconception i cant use my financial aid to study abroad truth in almost all cases your federal aid stafford loans name grants etc can be used to study abroad and in some states you can use your state aid as well it is also not uncommon for your federal aid to increase when you study abroad since some of your school scholarships may not transfer misconception host families are all poor and just do it for the money truth the last thing any study abroad company wants to do is have an unhappy student on their program the goal is for the students to be happy so that they will tell their friends what a great time they had if we were putting students in bad families in dangerous neighborhoods then no one would ever recommend us to their friends since the number of universities that endorse our program doubled over the last year its a pretty sure bet that students are happy with our choice of families misconception ill be so busy with schoolwork that i wont get time to see the country im in truth this one is hysterically funny since your average study abroad student comes home with about photos from a long list of countries students have plenty of opportunities to travel and we even take our students on trips to give them a better feel for the country they are in misconception i might not graduate on time if i go abroad truth if you have already used up all of your elective or general education courses then its true that you might need to bulk up on courses before or after you go abroad if you plan ahead however and leave some electives open to you then you should be fine the clear majority of students who study abroad still graduate in four years despite being away from their home campus for a semester or two misconception most of the world hates americans so i wont be safe truth theres no doubt that there are a lot of people who dont like the american government but that has nothing to do with the american people if you compare the violent crime rate in the united states to that of european australian or asian countries you will see that the united states is actually far more dangerous there are some areas of south america and africa that are not especially safe but there are also many countries on those continents that are incredibly safe go to the us state department website and check out the crime statistics on the country you are interested in to see how safe it is studying abroad is a onceinalifetime opportunity that every college student should take advantage of before dismissing it due to the bad experience of one friend or rumors you have had heard speak with your study abroad advisor and get the facts i guarantee that once you look at all that studying abroad can offer you youll be hopping the first flight abroad one organization that help ensure that you have safest unforgettable yet affordable study abroad experience is academic studies abroad here are some of our very popular study abroad programsin the following countries name spain academic studies offers study abroad programs in barcelona madrid name and sevilla name england academic studies offers study abroad programs in london name italy academic studies offers study abroad programs in florence name france academic studies offer study abroad programs in aixenprovence and avignon,0

neutrality requires that each article or other page in the mainspace fairly represents all significant viewpoints that have been published by reliable sources in proportion to the prominence of each viewpoint in the published reliable sources this is what you have quoted me unfortunately that is not helpful i appreciate your attempts but my point that is falling on deaf ears here is this is not a matter of personal opinion my frustration is only with individuals who believe this is a view point i have clearly laid out why this is not a pov piece and still not a single user has proven otherwise assuming it is a view point simply because it is too long is that really a legitimate argument or is name simply offended that i have challenged the careless lack of regard for scientific knowledge giving due weight and avoiding giving undue weight means that articles should not give minority views as much of or as detailed a description as more widely held view i am sorry you think i am in the minority is the same conclusion reached by the world health organization aap cps dermatology associations worldwide and anyone who has actually objectively reviewed the literature and the tactics used by the industry for people to say that i am in the minority perhaps in the court of public opinion but isnt that how propaganda works there is not even a shred of doubt based on scientific facts that what is transpiring is propaganda this is not even open for debate but these people are seriously compromising the integrity of this website by acting like gods claiming they know more about propaganda than i based on health information and an industry that they dont fully understand i can by the way generalize about the industry as it is represented by the jcta which is the organization i cite in the article on what basis cna they do this i ask all of them and they suddenly become sensitive and cite wp and claim i am the one who is personally attacking them,0

while many of your edit suggestions are certainly reasonable im afraid i must oppose the name change and removal of the word murder name is by far the most accurate and significant element of this event referring to this as a simple home invasion ignores what made this event notable specifically the premeditated murder of two people therefore the title should reflect such i also disagree with your assessment that murder is polarizing term or even a term of legal art name is what it is and it best describes content of this article,0

beauty pageants just because you have no interest in beauty pageants or their contestants doesnt mean that they are not notable and please dont go trying to delete stuff when you are ignorant about the topic you are dealing with i happen to think there are tons of articles on here that do not meet wikipedias standards and that do not have individual merit particularly those about comics etc but i am wise enough to know that i do not truly understand their significance and so i leave it alone a much more prudent avenue would have been to bring your issues to the appropriate wikiproject wikiproject name and to address yoru concerns there in the first instance one example the continual use of the term model to describe them as has been used by yourself and one other editor is both incorrect and somewhat demeaning,0

well in case anyones interested in following up on this further using the la trobe university online search engine a search for the term mah purisalakkha truncated to allow for various inflections leads to bjt record hits at least of which are in the name canon heres the first page of the search results with links to the subsequent pages as well purisalakkha of course this is by no means a straightforward indicator of how many discourses actually reference this term nor what this term means in the context of various suttas since multiple records can be part of a single sutta similarly this is not a clear reflection of the total number of times that this term appears in the name literature as a single record could have multiple instances of the term and their might be other ways of formulating this phrase not addressed by the above truncated compound term etc fwiw a quick review of these results potentially suggestive of the distribution of this term in the various nikayas shows hits in the digha nikaya in the majjhima nikaya none in the samyutta nikaya in the anguttara nikaya and in the canonical khuddaka nikaya mostly in the suttanipata in the paracanonical kn words eg netti peta one in the abhidhammas kathavatthu once in the visuddhimagga and times in the name histories if nothing else this distribution perhaps suggests that suttas identified by name and myself might possibly be among the core texts with metta talk,0

for the record larson was working on a battlestar pegasus movie for about months when it became apparent that name wasnt going to go anywhere with the name franchise it turned out that larson did have the rights through some contractual snafu on names part to do anything with commander name and the pegasus and his planned film involved the search for an ancient battlestar called the atlantis which was built by the 13th tribe and deliberately left in a secret location with the maps to earth the film would have dealt with the search a major battle with the cylons and the recovery and use of the maps to reach earth all wo involving the name or the rtf other than being mentioned the first article google shows is this one and the wikipedia set up for bsg had this one although im not sure about whether theres some name about referencing other miniwikis name article on the attempt is at hollywood north report has a short blurb about the larson effort but seeing as how their site has a lot of popups from spammers attempting to load trojans and spyware ill quote it here to save your systems in the spring of it was announced that name was making plans to bring name to the silver screen impressed with the visual effects and style of the independently financed film wing commander larson paired with its producer name on an estimated million film that was to shoot later that year in luxembourg the story picked up where the series left off but followed the exploits of commander name and the battlestar pegasus made famous in the original series episode the living legend guest starring the late name in the concept commander names search for the lost battlestar name leads him to contemporary earth which according to the story was settled by humans who arrived here during prehistoric times on the very first battlestar atlantis special effects were to be handled by moyers company no prisoners 3dfx utilizing several of the artists who worked on wing commander moyer planned to update some of names ships including giving the vipers the ability to morph into mechanized walkers la the transformerswhen on planet surfaces moreover he and larson planned to expand the name franchise to include an imax film a theme ride and a new line of merchandise then as quickly as it had been announced the project vanished from the radar screen it has been suggested that larson and moyer ultimately found themselves at odds over significant creative issues it has also been suggested that the film rights to battlestar name were still in some dispute in either case the project disappeared into the ethers iirc cylonorg had a page on this at one time but since they revised their site this one and its copies of the concept drawings they had have disappeared,0

possible images so i just removed a huge mate1 ad from the article because in my opinion although i believe it was added in good faith by userkrw its inappropriate for an article about a general product or service to feature prominently the advertising or image of one single product within the class some examples i looked at included soft drink where the main picture shows a variety of brands on a supermarket shelf with a photo of the diet pepsi product line much lower down potato chip where two of the three pictures are of chips without packaging and the third is a noncurrent ad fast food where all of the food is shown unwrapped and only the big mac is clearly identifiable plus a nondescript interior photo and a photo of several adjacent restaurants chocolate bar with an unwrapped chocolate bar shown this brings up a quandry what do we use for images my best ideas are to make mockups of a hypothetical dating site front page or ad and use them instead of real images suggestions,0

npov tag an anonymous user removed the npov tag yesterday without any comment i dont think the article is quite ready for that yet because its problems are not really resolved it retains a poison pen hangover from what seemed to be edits from anonymous users with an agenda and we ended up with some odd compromises like a name mention in the first paragraph shes really not important enough imho dodgy sources like cnsnewscom continued overemphasis of race etc others may not agree but lets see,0

cadaver sanguisugus hi do you have a scholarly source for the term cadaver sanguisugus having been used at least once by name or anyone else i notice that there are a lot of google hits on vampire forums etc but according to this paper only the word sanguisuga occurs and it is translated by historian name as a leech in the name sourcebook edition of newburgh the sentence reads the young men however spurred on by wrath feared not and inflicted a wound upon the senseless carcass out of which incontinently flowed such a stream of blood that it might have been taken for a leech filled with the blood of many persons,0

i think red tape accurately and succinctly communicates the situation you describe especially given that in a prior version you yourself wrote attempts to rectify this situation working through official channels did not work which it seems to me is the very essence of extreme red tape if you like we can say instead official indifference or unresponsiveness but i dont see how that better informs the reader i also dont see how your wording makes the point you mention re success in decrypting and the importance of that success obviously a request for more resources will try to convince the recipient that such will help the writers to better do what theyve been tasked to do to spell out that their desire was to achieve the productivity that was possible would be completely superflous of course that was the goal and surely no reader needs to be told that better productivity faster decrypting etc meant the entire difference between valuable intelligence and useless retrospective your wording doesnt mention any of that stuff anyway further as ive said before i also dont see why it matters what specific type of resource was lacking the important points are a the codebreakers felt that they could not do the best job possible without more resources b name unhesitatingly granted them carte blanche showing the importance he attached to their work and the breadth of his authority in making such decisions what doesnt matter is just what it was that was lacking typists paperclips light bulbs some of these elements could be incorporated to enliven the narrative eg some kind of for want of a nailtype angle look prime minister youve gathered all these firstclass minds here but we cant get anything done because we have to do our own bloody typing if sources lay something like that out am i missing something ps what do you mean about wpciv,0

january utc check the editing history most if not all of the edits to the side of definite have come from homosexually aligned people and only given partial assent by some heterosexuals whom are willing to give in to the speculative pov that you find as factual and want a fight to the death over how come you people have no grasp of the royal court or politics why involve yourself then except for tendentious editing you only dig a deeper hole by trying to make this article toe the line of homosexual propaganda which has unbelievably assimilated homophobic oaths about the king and turned him into a homosexual according to your own minds these are observations not allegations the editing history is clear furthermore because your collectively unscrupulous behaviors such as using logical fallacies and mob mentality of your wikiproject to force the issue we have adolescents coming here to vandalize the article with fag jokes you turn a great study into infamy all by exaggeration of scandal and not even the real issues at hand which were so critical to the events which happened in 17th century england,0

the name passage is quoted in the moloch article in the encyclop didia biblica as the strongest evidence for the theory that the offerings were considered to be to name along with name both passages are also cited in the moloch aritlce in the catholic encyclopedia which reponds rather weakly in my opinion but this position is to say the least improbable the texts appealed to may well be understood otherwise and the prophets expressly treat the cult of moloch as foreign and as an apostasy from the worship of the true god it is cited in encyclop dia britannica moloch with the comment note also the attitude of name in xx seq references which cannot be explained away the article the international standard bible encyclopedia molech moloch treats it rather strangely remarkingthat this prophet regarded the practice as among the statutes that were not good and ordinances wherein they should not live name given by god to his people by way of deception and judicial punishment as some hold is highly improbable and inconsistent with the whole prophetic attitude toward it it is not clear what this means quoting parts of the passage and paraphasing part of it and then adding as some hold this article shows itself elsewhere quite aware of the theory that infants were sacrificed to name it also brings in bogus molochworship in connection to carthage not a good article in any case three different rabbinical interpretations of the name passage appear at the interpretation by rashi accords with the most obvious meaning disliked by trs but the writer finds this inconvincing as not in accord with his own theology and prefers another interpretation that would not be a reason to suppress rashis interpretation and the writer does not do so there is a discussion at which covers in part name treatment favorably but also discusses the name passage in respect to the problem of the peoples belief and apparently names beliefs that commands which name saw as bad came from name note name believes moloch is not name but that still does not answer the problems with that passage in short the passage has been long used in support of the theory that the offerings of children lmlk was understood as commanded by name it has long been in general a problem pasage but those who feel that it is being misinterpreted do not suppress it it is dishonest to present a theory that has been held and still is held and suppress its strongest supporting argument on could respond by citing the catholic encyclopedia response which seems to me weak but add it with a citation if you will but do not suppress the inclusion is not editorializing by me i am presenting various theories that are held along with evidence for and against the name passage is cited as part of a common argument that children were sacrificed to name and normally used as support for that argument indeed one of the main sources for that argument my own pov as much as i have one is that the evidence is confused there are good arguments as well as weaknesses in various positions and that one should present all sides though of course full discussion would be a book length article your particular pov on a biblical passages is not grounds to suppress it when cited with a different interpretation especially when it is normally cited in the moloch context by sources usually considered reputable sometimes very much supporting the pov that the sacrifices were to name even when when that interpretation is rejected the name passage is still cited in discussion i dont believe that anything i have included in this article including the name passage is nonstandard for discussion of moloch i have tried to present the vanilla arguments and give enough information to allow them to be understood one obviously cannot agree with all sides moloch cannot easily be at once name an entirely different god the name of a kind of sacrifice passing through fire cannot be at the same time a human sacrifice or an initiation ceremony but people do hold different views and the task of the article is to explain these views and give their history it should be obvious now that your original feeling that this material was novel was incorrect please let the normal statements used as arguments stand regardless of the positions i am restoring the passage with some reasonable weasel words to make it clearer that this is the expound,0

im not even sure what you mean when you stated just trying to help make you piece sound better do you mean your piece if so this isnt my piece its an article written from the contribution of many editors i did not author the sentence you are trying to modify secondly you didnt just change a phrase you added leading to terminus which was part of my reason for reverting if you read the entire sentence its somewhat redundant to add that and finally theres nothing unprofessional about the term railroad in fact its actually a better fit if you look up the definition for railway youll find that its often used to describe a type of railroad that operates over short distances we have no idea if thats true or not and therefore railroad is actually preferred,0

i could have been reminded too but was banned and then threatened by you in response the policy here is often to ban first and ask questions later i think i am just about done with name it is a laughing stock of an encyclopedia lampooned daily in the press and print world the onion daily show colbert report have all picked on it for just the kind of thing i encountered daily as an editor here it seems that censorship is the core issue behind almost all of what afflicts the site yet when it is called out by a fellow contributor it gets some phony we are all friends being neutral rhetoric lobbed back and no progress is ever made you say you are following the rules even if you are there are higher rules like truth which should trump the petty stuff but that whole just following orders excuse is so typically self defeating it embarrasses me to say i am human at what point does a person ask the tougher question like what is the truth and hold that question to a standard that trumps all other things example that is why men get hanged when a judge decides dna evidence wont be used no one is interested in truth they would rather hang an innocent than seek or pursue the truth does it matter that the dna evidence came in on a thursday at 4pm after the evidence cutoff time for that judges jurisdiction or does it matter more that the evidence shows clear innocence you would be the guy saying revert rule clearly states no evidence therefore all that follows is inadmissable you are that guy who gasses jews and says the rules as you interpeted them suggested that was within the guidelines laid out by the almight founder of name and you are the guy strip searching year old women on airlplanes in search of bombs because the rules clearly state search everyone no common sense is left in the entire world but we in the us are committed to our stupidity moreso than most what ever happened to good ole common sense go back and read through what was posted in the exchanges and try to fix the article offer something constructive to the world and stop haggling over the small stuff you make no mention of the substance of the article just enlightening me about the rules thanks,0

why not worrying more about adding new info why do ya care about vandals more than actually being constructive and adding new infoi placed a section called new thougths and ideas a week ago and bearly anybody cares about it every idea or opinion should be added here first before actually being added in the article ill be much more easy to add it in this section and the vote for concensus the problem here is that most of the users argue about sock puppets and other dumb shitbe more constructive and add less crap to the talk pagethis is one of the longest talk page,0

as a matter of curiosity as a matter of curiosity if a person with a circumcision fetish found his way to this article would they be allowed to edit it as an authentic observer by the way the circumcision in front of the grass hut on page of the who pamphlet global trends would indicate that the purported hiv protection targets village people who live in primitive conditions would that also target the englishspeaking readers of a wiki site like wikipedia anyone ever hear of an educational foundation known as the name perhaps an entry in this article could describe their work unfortunately it appears anyone may edit the article regardless of a conflict of interest i have also questioned the relevance and impact of third world african hiv studies on our modern audience to no avail thanks for the link to a conflict of interest since there are a number of fellows who edit this article it would be helpful to know if any of them have information about the name described here it could be revelatory for circumcision wikipedia to include a section on the name who apparently have quite a mission its my understanding that gilgal is an obscure word for mountain of burning foreskins no one having objected to the proposed sections on circumcision fetish and the name i will assume a consensus delegate the research and get back here with it asap its impossible to assess such a vague proposal if you provide some specific sourced content we can assess its suitability we can assess now would that be the royal we or you claim to speak for other fellows we refers to myself and others who may be interested in evaluating the proposal all the same i dont get why you in particular deigned to represent the other fellows without asking their permission itll take a lot of human resources to put these sections together and if the consensus is already fixed in advance whats the point perhaps its a little presumptuous but its realistic its usually a safe bet that more than one person will comment on a proposed change take a look at the archives if you want to confirm that for yourself as for your proposals previous discussions have found that there are no reliable sources discussing a circumcision fetish searching google scholar for gilgal society indicates that there are no reliable secondary sources regarding that subject either so i would think it doubtful that content could be written in a way that conforms to our policies our policies you mean the name im not certain who youre representing here wikipedias policies obviously another reader deleted this interesting discussion for some reason in trying to improve the circumcision article its important that we discern between authentic readers and those who are paid a salary to patrol and manage this article thats not a personal attack nor a lack of presumption of good will its merely being realistic about who finds their way to this controversial article and a healthy cynicism about some readers intransigence one reader has left a very rude domineering comment on my user page if personal attacks like that are the norm i can only assume that a number of fellows are paid to patrol this article and its objectivity should be flagged on the title page,0

utc i dont think the definition from webbs really works given the change that has happened since it was first written the idea that professionals supply disinterested counsel and service to others for a direct and definite compensation wholly apart from expectation of other business gain is a bit naive particularly in the i think a more realistic and up to date defintion is required for instance in the light of holocaust in which many german professionals acted as instruments of a disfunctional state which would tend to indicate that service for others may not be have the intention but was taken to a tragic extreme likewise the recent financial crisis would tend to indicate that profession of banker if it is a profession has shown to conducted wholly for business gain ie higher profit larger bonuses whilst other professions have shown themselves to be very interested in business gain often to the detriment to the business eg accountants in the enron scandal i am not saying that perks is the ideal source of information but would suggest we need to cast around for a better definition and one that is couched in more modern language talkcontribs november,0
the truth about the name ard fheis the story of how name tried to turn an eighty year old revolutionary movement into a british constitutional party how he broke the name constitution created fake cumainn to give him fake votes and barred life long republicans from voting how he managed to expel himself and his supporters from name membership and how a small band of republicans managed to keep the name constitution and traditional policy in tact in section 1b of the name constitution read as follows no person who is a member of any political party organisation or who approves of or supports the candidature of persons who if elected intend taking part in the proceedings of the westminster or partitionist county or county parliaments or who approves of or supports the candidature of persons who sign any form or give any kind of written or verbal undertaking of intention to take their seats in these institutions shall be admitted to membership or allowed to retain membership the name leadership put forward a motion titled resolution at the ard fheis its wording was as follows resolution that this ardfheis drops its abstentionist attitude to leinster house successful sinn fein parliamentary candidates in county elections a name attend leinster house as directed by the ard chomhairle b name not draw their salaries for personal use parliamentary representatives shall be paid a sinn fein organiser s subsidy and the leinster house salary shall be divided at the direction of the ard chomhairle to defray national and constituency expenses to accommodate this change the constitution and rules be amended as follows that section 1b of the constitution be amended to read no person who is a member of any political party organisation or who approves of or supports the candidature of persons who if elected intend taking part in the proceedings of the westminster or partitionist county parliaments or who approves of or supports the candidature of persons who sign any form or give any kind of written or verbal undertaking of intention to take their seats in these institutions shall be admitted to membership or allowed to retain membership motion supports and approves of the candidature of persons who if elected would be of the intention to take their seats in certain circumstances ie on the direction of the ard chomhairle obviously motion infringes section 1b section 1b was in effect at the time this resolution was presented its clear that name made a mistake in procedure he should have sought a majority decision to amend section 1b in and returned in to propose entering leinster house trying to amend section 1b and propose taking seats in the partitionist county parliament in the same resolution was a logical impossibility can anybody say that the wording that this ardfheis drops its abstentionist attitude to leinster house successful sinn fein parliamentary candidates in county elections a name attend leinster house as directed by the ard chomhairle does not constitute the supporting and approving of the candidature of persons who intend to take their seats in leinster house as directed by the ard chomhairle clearly name was in breach of section 1b and according to that section he had expelled himself and all those who voted for resolution name in his book name turbulent years puts forward the argument that name had managed to bypass section 1b by introducing a motion in allowing the discussion of any aspect of the name constitution this change may indeed have facilitated debate on abstentionism but it did not infringe on the content or effect of section 1b in any way to discuss something is not the same as formally proposing or supporting it for example conventions are held regularly where drug addiction is discussed without any of the delegates proposing or supporting it in fact the line name added in was superfluous as the name constitution had never banned the discussion of anything just the approving and supporting of taking seats in named partitionist parliaments of course its not illegal to amend or remove section 1b section 1b bans the approval or support of candidates who intend to take seats in british assemblies it can be removed or amended at any ard fheis by a two thirds majority the reason for doing so could be many perhaps delegates might feel that it implies that they cannot be trusted to be loyal to the republic in fact its not necessary according to the constitution to give any reason but you,0

re your ae topic ban appeal sorry but it strains credulity mine anyway to believe that you didnt realize that the adam mickiewicz article was the subject of a dispute among lithuanian and polish editors with whom you are wellacquainted until the moment before you were going to hit save as you state here recent articletalk page history you havent edited the article since and you must have thousands of other articles that need improvement on your watchlist you could have posted an article edit request to the pl noticeboard re this as you have for many articles during the past few months in my view the am part of your appeal demonstrates what to call it a lack of forthcomingness the remainder of the appeal in which you speak of wps losses from your lack of participation thats a different story that others can think over if you remove the am section i shant contest your appeal since lifting your topic ban now or in march doesnt make much difference in the long run but i am concerned about that part possibly the readers will take your assertion at face value without checking the articletalk page histories you could either remove that section since it hasnt been commented on there yet or strike it if you choose not to do either i may bring it up at the ae appeal id prefer that we keep the conversation here but if youd rather have it on my talk page thats ok by me if so ill post talkbacks,0

july utc although i understand your arguments i am surprised you dont understand mine i dont find it labyrinthine or at least not particularly so not more than many other events and aspects concerning the name nor is the interpretation in question in any way obscure since it can be taken from any number of texts on the name however though i support the original authors intent here i guess you and i are going to have to agree to disagree over this point for now at some point however i will source hisher statements as soon as i find time to delve into the texts just because i would appreciate reaching some sort of accord with you until then i dont think we will make much more progress on this the problem with something like this is that there is no absolute truth but to me discrediting the original authors intent is like a dog biting its own tail from wikipedia re name being the final album or notname is the eleventh official album recorded by the name although its release preceded that of let it be it was the last album to be recorded after the neardisastrous sessions for the proposed get back album later retitled let it be for release name suggested to producer name that the group get together and make an album just like the old days just like we used to free of the conflict that began with the sessions for the white album martin agreed to this if the band would be the way they used to be in their interviews for the name anthology series the surviving band members stated they knew at the time this would very likely be the final name product and therefore they agreed to set aside their differences and go out on a high notere the position of the endthe end was initially intended to be the final track on name but it is followed by her majesty in the first practice mix of the medley constructed on july her majesty followed mean mr mustard etc this labyrinth has already been walked through a thousand times by a thousand people,0

your argument is that we should take your word over that of the sources all you have said is your own personal opinion and original research rather than facts supported by reliable sources as i stated earlier present reliable sources stating otherwise if you disagree with the sources given secondly there is nothing wrong with the integrity of the sources given you claim that the global financial centres index commissioned by the city of london corporation must be biased because it is based in london you fail to mention the other two sources given forbes and name both of which are american and based in new york city nor do you provide any sources supporting your notion that the city of london corporation is a biased institution it is clear from this argument that the article faces two choices it can go with names own personal opinion and original research or the word of the city of london corporation forbes and name,0

legislation european union the atricle claims the european union has ratified a law banning incitement to or denial of genocide both the holocaust and the armenian genocide the source reads the european union has just ratified a law banning incitement to or denial of genocide arguably including both the holocaust and the armenian genocide some enthusiasts removed the word arguably when citing the source lets have a look at the law itself framework decision on combating racism and xenophobia official press release certain forms of conduct as outlined below which are committed for a racist or name are punishable as criminal offences public condoning denying or grossly trivialising crimes of genocide as defined in the statute of the international criminal court articles and and crimes defined in article of the charter of the international military tribunal when the conduct is carried out in a manner likely to incite violence or hatred against such a group or a member of such a group example somebody publicly claims that an act of genocide the commission of which has been established as a fact by an international court never happened and was invented by the ethnic group concerned solely for the purpose of being able to claim compensation payments this allegation would not only deny the genocide committed against the ethnic group concerned but would also incite hatred against this group in the future all member states would be compelled to criminalise such a case whether a specific historical crime falls within these definitions must be decided in each concrete case by the court which has jurisdiction in the case of the holocaust for example this was done by the nuremberg tribunal as we see the law is restricted to cases when the commission of genocide is established by an international court and the denial is carried out in a manner likely to incite violence or hatred is the commission of armenian genocide established by an international court,0

that would be pretty odd for those declassified documents to mention a movie that was created after the events for which both the movie and the documents do related about the declassified documents were not synthesized for the movie unless you want to prove a conspiracy on the synthesis very odd it is perfectly valid to use the documents to relate to the same historical events to further verify the what happened but the use of primary source in such a was is not ideal for wikipedia since it is not ideal that is why i left it here on the talk page if someone wants to research it more to find ideal references,0

narking ok and that disproves my point how i said that advisors are stationed in georgia proper buffer zones are un controlled areas of georgia proper so its a georgian mission you said that advisors are stationed in georgia proper so its a georgian mission well done name i get million links when i google south ossetia war thats english buddy if only name you read the title security council holds third emergency meeting as south ossetia conflict intensifies expands to other parts of georgia south ossetia conflict war expands as in already expanded it says expands not expanding or about to expand therefore the un knowingly named the war the south ossetia war knowing that it will expand see how important reading the title and getting the correct title is my arguments havent evaporated anywhere south ossetia is still locationbased my initial argument it is still where over of the fighting took place it still has the most important battle tskhinvali my arguments are still here buddy and name i have pointed to you countless times that might doesnt make right saying the majority says so does not make it npov if you would have lived in the south during the civil rights movenment youd realize that might doesnt make right or npov for that matter ive seen your majority view point and called it a farce many times name have proof for how the georgia war is biased it is biased because it implies that south ossetia was a name part of georgia which as we all know is bullshit because if a region is name and de jure part of a country there is no war my russian colleagues may disagree but chechnya was not name part of russia in the s it was de jure and it was called the second chechen war not the russian war so in other words mr name and the other two of you you have failed to show my how south ossetia war is npov but i have shown you and cited an example of how georgia war would be incorrect and biased therefore the title stays case closed,0

up to your old tricks i see thankfully i have not had the displeasure or the need to smell your odious stench on this site for a while as thankfully wikipedia is large enough to avoid contemptible creatures like you however i notice we have crossed swords again with you crying out your age old mantra like the fucktard you are its unsourced well done fucking well done you are so pigshit thick and lazy rather than do a little bit of work and find some sources yourself you just delete stuff because it takes less effort or assume good faith most people dont make stuff up that they add if you had one iota of sense in that pigshit brain of yours you would at least do a quick internet search to check the facts before having a wpown fap and then deleting anything that you like personally i think and i have said this before you make absolutely no positive contributions to this site just looking at your edit log clearly shows you generate nothing or even bother to write something er this is an encyclopedia if you had your way it would be whittled down to nothing you have got talent or knowledge except selfimportance because its easier to be a fucking name than an editor i have nothing but the utter contempt for you because you cannot even do the most simplest of things and look up something if wikipedia is measured by the likes of you then its stands by the lowest common denominator ignorance your application of sourcing is so fucked up and arbitrary its laughable are you the sort asshole who needs to see it on the news to figure out the popes a catholic etc after seeing what you have been up to butchering articles like a retard with a paper cutter i pray to all things dark and evil that you will eventually fuck with one of this sites even worse selfimportant cunts then when you suffer massive butthurt youll quit and realise it was also fucking pointless being such a grandstanding bastard,1

article is still disputed several sections of this article added by iskapoo name were regularly removedcensored by itaqallah and others this article is still in dispute please do not remove the tag until all the disputes involving this article are resolved if you wish to know what is in dispute read the talk page you will find a very long discussion there are realize that the recent inactivity was due to several persons including iskapoo name giving up any hope of maintaining a balanced viewpoint due to the constant censorship of itaqallah and others are you sure you understand the tags youve put up there is clearly no controversial or unsourced content in the article that alludes to this looks more like a heap of tags just to say you dont like the article as it stands neither you nor your colleagues have given any detailed reason why the removal of crankish poorly sourced fringe material contravenes wpnpov and how the material isnt in violation of wpblp whereas i have shown it is please stop vandalizing this article by removing the tags your behavior has become a burden on most wikipedians please demonstrate that you understand the issues at hand and are not merely placing tags so as to register your personal grievances with the page you can do so by actually explaining how the tags are justified and how the fringe material removed doesnt violate core content policies useragnistus has claimed the neutrality of this article is disputed that is legitimate now id like to now what is it in the article that agnistis finds to be a violation of wppov i advise name to give the user hours or the next time he signs on whichever is earlier to produce hisher reasons for placing the tag thank you agnistus for your anticipated cooperation dear you do not know that the article is disputed crankish poorly sourced fringe material the statements by zakir naik on the rights on nonmuslims were properly sourced material of much importance to the articleto maintain a balanced viewpoint you have repeatedly and continously indulged in deletion of this material your actions have constituted a blatant violation of wpblp read the page long talk page and you will understand the reasons for the disputed status you are probably blind to this gross censorship since you yourself were the censor until and unless a fully balanced viewpoint is presented ofcourse in compliance with wpblp in the article the tag cannot be removed btw there is absolutely no necessity for a hour window as it is perfectly clear to any nonislamic fundamentalist from the talk page that this article is totally disputed and if you itaqallah still feel the material that you censored was crankish poorly sourced fringe material then please visit and please read the articles on zakir naik in and agnistus i can only gather from your response that you have little basis in policy for inserting your tendentious unreliable material or what amounts to a pointish protest tag youtubecom isnt a reliable source wikiislam and faithfreedomorg are unreliable polemical websites which cannot be considered as reliable sources on any topic let alone a living person perhaps you have missed wikipediabiographies of living persons and praise wprs wpv but your objection seems to be that your own personal perspective is not copiously represented could you please tell me how videos of zakir naik on youtubecom are not reliable do you think some video artist carefully crafted those videos and put it up there only,0

you have not made any compromise youve only added original research unappropriated templates and removed a perfectly acceptable source and all that without opening a discussion with the community to see whether other editors would agree with you and worse when it was made clear that your edits were unacceptable again i merely followed the criterion from the reliable source policy you just ignored that and kept reverting to what you wanted without providing any policyrelated reasons,0
i have made an edit which i believe is compliant with names neutrality guidelines while leaving the word extremist in the article while i do not agree that the statement lends any value to the article at least attempting to cite it in the manner of my recent edit keeps the article factual since it merely quotes rather than appears to agree with a bias in one of its sources i hope that further edits along these lines will involve how best to use the bias statement rather than edits which introduce bias into the article itself,0

you resorting to dishonesty is disgusting and vile name for starters dating back to the original discussion back in december while the user name liked financialnorth1 he preferred a cropped version of the fourth photo to which no including nameh or you for that matter said anything as clearly noted in the discussion as im saying again for the umpteenth time and as the record showed no decision was made and the discussion ended name or you did not say anything if he wanted the photo then why didnt he continue to press his case then and convince a consensus then i wouldve left it at that then but instead he and other editors remained silent i didnt restart the discussion because i assumed that the editors simply lost interest or didnt have the time furthermore i did not slip in as you disgustingly dishonestly facetiously say i only added that photo because i noticed for the time being that no one had made a decision since the original discussion back in january again no one did anything for months you and name cannot claim you didnt see the change because you made several other edits throughout the article for months again name did not form a consensus prior to the change or continue the discussion where it had left off once again he instead changed the photo got a consensus from name the ip editor liked the photo but quoting the editor again any of the photos in that section financialnorthjpg montgomerystreetsfjpg federal reserve band san franciscojpg except sanfranciscoembarcaderojpg would be fine as a replacement and even the cropped version of is better than the one currently there now thoughts talk im going to replace it with financialnorthjpg and see what happens the crux of it was that name made the change before even name approved it or i or other editors could respond names abusive little crusade against me shows my point that he and name have no interest in perusing collaborative editing efforts despite my reverts i at least agreed to having a discussion and a photo choosing contest as it were name did not and name is now acting as some kind of enforcing i dont see name asking the ip editor in question or other editors to the sf article including name have their say either in this he is not apologizing to me and asking that we resume the discussion and consensus something that at least name did earlier only showing his intentions as pure slander towards me as attempt to have me banned purely because he disagrees with my edits or whatever personal victory he may get by flaming me,0

name to br rewritten i believe this whole article needs to be rewritten fromntop to bottom in jumps around in a chronological sense thereby notbshowingbin a cohesive way how improvisational theatre has developed there is a lot of text devoted to thevwork of name but his work is no more important than dozens of other writers moreover his importance is no where near as significant in the us as is the work of spolin shepherd sills and close and the rolenof io and the second city the article in its present form looks like a hodgepodge of sentences and paragraphs from many authors with no attention paid to consistency a rewrite would also avoid some duplication how does one initiate such a process who selects the person to take the first stab at it i would propose that name of los angeles do the rewrite he has a masters degree in improvisation from nyu personally knows many of the people who have created modern improvisational theatre shepherd sills close halpern to name a few and is a professional writer his latest credit is for writing the film name a lifetime of improvisational theatre any thoughts,0
so name gets to personally attack assume bad faith and violate wp policy by removing chunks of material from my own comment in an article talk page gotcha i do not accept your decision as valid fair or equitably applied i only wrote on names talk page because he was violating wp policy and insulting me and undoing my comments on the article talk page and ignoring and disrespecting all the work and goodfaith presentations i made on the article talk page you agree iwth him removing chunks of my comment on the article talk page though wp does not allow that youre facilitating bad behavior on his partby totally ignoring it or not seeing it and singling me out in this matter very wrong did you even read what i wrote on your talk page im not saying i was necessarily totally perfect in the edit situation timeline or in my tone on the talk page my point sir is name has been farrr from perfect himself and has definitely violated wp policy yet you wont even see it or get on him for it or block him for doing all this you notice i did not personally attack doug weller or name why because they were civil and cool and you never gave me a full chance to even defend myself on the notice board page so i dont agree at all with your action name has been unquestionably out of line and you dont see any of his stuff on the article talk page or the nonsense and badfaith insults and accusations and negativity he hurled at me left and right why is that,0

thanks for replying off hand im not convinced that investigating your reply wizard and how it works would have speeded up this conversation i checked the deletion log before querying this with you it merely refers to criteria f7 invalid fair use claim without any further explanation of exactly why as you have now given in this instance the stamp image is not used simply as an illustration where as per policy an alternative illustration for example by scanning the covers and creating a similar collage could have been created it also makes an important contribution to the discussion of the series by demonstrating that it is sufficiently important for a stamp to have been created depicting the series as a whole the existence of the stamp itself is noteable for a mention in the article i note that criteria is not a wiki policy but merely a guideline and is stated to be one example of acceptable usage not an exhaustive list the policy above states that usage must follow the spirit of the policy at the top of the page not the guideline list of examples regards,0

firstly some of the examples you used were from the personal attack pagesmaybe you should read your own posts also the reason i decided they were inane and decided to ignore them was because they did not directly apply to what i had said perhaps they applied to the numerous inferences that you made in reference to what i said but they did not apply to what i said and meant perhaps you could try not to infer or assume what i mean and try not to take offense so easily i am respecting the basic rules of wikipedia but i also exploited loop holes in the rules so if you want to include what i did in the rules then do so but you should state what you want and not infer your own meaning and im so upset because you and several other people have been complete and total assholes to me and to another person who tried to post this same page you asked that we do something ie explain the significance of the clan etc and we did but you deleted it anyway and then you ask for more stuff and you give it to us also one of the pages i read on here says that the information has to be verifiable but not the truthwell what kind of bullshit is that if this is truly an encyclopedia then dont you state the truth also if i go and post some article some other place rather than the clans home page then i can site that and it becomes verifiable right if you say no then this is just another example of something that is not explicitly stated and a loop hole that people can exploit before you go around messing with other peoples posts maybe you could get your rules and priorities straight,0

i think youre splitting too many hairs here its very apparent that she and summer are gonna have some business and its become obvious that shes graduated from from mere manager to a fighting diva people like name or zeb colter or hoganlitagunn tough enough are there in nonphysical roles and are listed as such name has clearly made the jump from that status personally i think the other onair personnel list should be strictly for those in nonphysical roles once name started throwing down with summer and it became clear that theyre destined for a match then name showed that shes above being merely other personnel uservjmlhds user talkvjmlhdstalk,0

i also agree with arranging by arcs ive pointed it out several times and been ignored well at least they included the arcs again they deleted that info completely before organising by the english dvds is just plain whatever and typical of some whatever who think theyre the center of the world the problem is theyve spent considerable time in making separate articles yes you hear right for each of their socalled dvd seasons which are dvd releases actually so not even the naming is appropriate and theyre not willing to give up undo all their whatever useless work it seems they dont like truths here so whatever,0
thats basically an oxymoron and it shows how little your understanding of the worldwide definition of christian basically you believe there should be a litmus test for christian meaning just identifying with the religion isnt enough if according to you the individual doesnt pass the litmus test that would be like me asserting that the hijackers werent muslims because they visited a strip bar the night before the terror attack which violates the teachings of islam and is nonsenical i changed the link to bornagain christian,0

yep and after you vandalized it again i rereverted it dipshit,1
some of these things i have already changed or deleted a province really does not have a monetary policy though it can do some things e g about the availability of cash and the phrase was too general to begin with so thats gone i changed did nothing to stop to did not work to stop though your criticism is valid note however that when name took office argentina was already in recession or on the brink of it and the government concentrated on contractive measures from the start then came the corralito etc on the whole the measures were intended to stop the collapse of the economy and all the economic analysts and the imf were recommending them i dont remember any major economist recommending an alternative course of action note also that economic collapse doesnt refer only to the critical period november february but to the whole recessive period and some time before and after we should agree on a phrase that links names measures with the crisis without falling into any of did not work to stop the economic collapse ended up precipitating the economic collapse ultimately caused the economic collapse were intended to cause the economic collapse had nothing to do with the economic collapse then the importdependent thing consider this right after the devaluation neighboring countries had to help us get medicine the public hospital where i worked initially could not get xray film from the providers and then only by paying in cash and in dollars argentina then and still now is incapable of sustaining economic growth without importing certain forms of technology id say thats rather importdependent though we may be speaking of different things what do you propose whats the problem with the religious aspects of the supreme justices the previous justices were all old male and ideologically conservative and in addition some had ties to the right wing of the catholic church and now two of them are women one is the president of the court and the other is a militant atheist in her own words the clarification is intended to show the reader that the changes introduced in the supreme court were really important names atheism in particular was even reported as a salient fact in international media in a country where the church attacks anyone who dares speak of womens rights having these two women at the top of one of the countrys government branches is extremely significant the qualification historical for the payment to the imf is that correct me if im wrong argentina had never decided to pay so much to the imf or anyone else not only at the same time but also ahead of schedule and this payment has redefined the relationship of argentina with the imf and swept with many assumptions about the economic future of the country that were valid before the payment im glad were discussing this here civilly understand that noone here is that i know affiliated with a party or a person if someone is it doesnt show and that we dont have an ideological police or a bureaucracy that you have to go through before correcting what you believe is wrong in an article but when an article is not very new and deals with an important topic you have to consider that most of the content is settled already and should be treated carefully to avoid being or being seen as disruptive its perfectly ok for us to discuss over the tiniest details here please sign after your comments and replies here using four tildes when you save the page theyll be converted to your username and current datetime its easier to keep track that way talk,0

i think wikipedia does have an obligation of respect and we do selfcensor quite a bit we can show selfrestraint and respect and yet show the community what they want to see such as photos of the garments there are no nude or seminude photos on other religious articles why start here if a photo needs to be shared let it be current and without a live model or at least a model with a face why are they so ashamed to have their faces in the photos ebay and flickr more have up to date photos not these from the 80s or 90s this is completely offensive to the bulk of lds readers on wikipedia protecting the page is not the answer to keeping an image on it rather lets find something that the community can agree on and this current version it not it and undoubtedly as cogden stated end up with continuous vandalism of the page,0

if someone feels that an editor has been editing disruptively it is perfectly in order for them to report it to administrators to consider whether any action should be taken it is a matter of courtesy to warn the user in advance that doing so is being considered and to give the editor a chance to stop in fact a report to administrators is likely to be simply dismissed if no warning has been given first i do think that more friendly wording might have been used rather than i will report you to wikipedia admins and have you blocked but i have seen far more uncivil warnings than that the ip editor has just given you that one message since your last edit to the article and since you say that you are done with the article it may be that heshe will leave it at that if the ip editor persists in posting to you about it after you have stopped editing the article then please come back and tell me as that may well be harassment and action may well be needed but if what has happened so far is the end of it then i dont see any reason for not just letting it drop,0

yes youre right theologically catholicism is very different to american protestantism which gave birth to the creationist movement and are certainly not interested in the sort of fundamentalist theocracy that most of them want sure they use the teleological argument but phrase it in theological language which is a lot different from scientific language and hence it isnt pseudoscience which is what irks me as a scientist but i dont understand theology probably because ive been trained to think too scientifically and the catholic church most of the time has better things to do than make statements on scientific issues but catholics are really into authority so what the hierarchy says goes dunc,0

this is the most ridiculous nonsense ever i honestly think that whoever is doing this needs to be reported to wikipedia how can a local newspaper to egremont which is completely free of charge and carries important and relevant stories to the town be removed what possible reason can you have other than i personally dont like links you are denying visitors to the page a relevant source of information about the town those visitors sought out on wikipedia because of some petty and childish desire to seem official you really should ask yourself whether removing this link was beneficial to visitors to wikipedia or whether you just denied them a source of relevant information,0

the fact that name are mixed turkic speaking people that sprung from the turkish invasion points to the fact that they did not just appear they were and are in the location that was name that consistent of albanians and iranian tribes furthermore the fact that the entire area was called name then for some reason was renamed name is another indication that name were not a turkic speaking group that just living side by side in the caucus next to the sakas no one said name in the north do not have differences when compared to other iranians in fact iranians are a multiethnic multi lingual group much like the kurds in the west have a different languagecustoms as do balochies in the south what happened to iranians in name intermittingly in which the turks invaded their tribes and the albanians were driven out and imposed their language on them via elite dominance does not change their original ancestry you have again failed to give a single rationale as to where the name came from why they even appearare part of iran even today and why these ethnic groups even have a persian culture in all you can concentrate on their differences but fail to explain where did name come from it is astonishing how some choose to skip many important facts and write pages of texts about germanic peoples in an article about iranian peoples i think i ll stop at that,0
reply many distributors say not to use chlorine bleach nor cationic sufactants fabric relaxers fabric conditioners aiui too high a concentration of bleach may distort the fibers please confirm the cationic surfactant will fill the holes in the microfiber and reduce its efficiency similarly microfiber should not be washed at too high temperatures eg celsius however it is hard to get microfiber to release the dirt it holds and so the method of washing needs to be a bit of a compromise do not wash with other garments especially those which shed small particles of fiber as these will be taken in and held by the microfiber cloth there does not seem to be a case for using special detergents again some will advocate using a drier but the temperature must not be so high as to distort the micro fibers i would not want to iron or press washed microfiber because of the possible loss of the dirt traps some distributors will suggest the use of bleach eg 3m and its scotchbrite microfiber kitchen cloths and others will specify rather high temperatures perhaps their microfibers have been treated or manufactured to withstand such washing but i am not sure how it could have been achieved name,0

trivia is just that trivia its trivial by nature just because you think its interesting doesnt mean its useful as the onus is on the editor adding material perhaps we might have a reason for this list to be here what other films and i mean good articles contain such a shopping list of items what is useful about knowing that a film uses artistic licence and props that arent the real thing is that really so surprising that every one has to be listed and ive heard the ignore and rules pleading before a very good way to cut that line of argument short is to ask how does it improve the article,0
when i looked at the cato edit it was simply a removal of the reference the addition of another donor and a change in the language without an edit summary to explain the changes were unjustified your clarification certainly helps thanks also for adding the reference on name frankly i did not look at the sources removed or added my main concern was the unexplained edits summaries are important and then i saw that the messages about these same concerns from a while back so my message is more of a reminder most importantly you are incorrect if you think it is not against the rules to add unsourced material one of the core content policies is wpv and wprs allows us to carry out that policy happy editing,0

hi name the source that youve used the strategy written by name is okay but it would be very good if you would also mention some thirdparty source that discusses or describes the strategy in the lingo of wikipedia i think the strategy itself is called a primary source but wikipedia generally prefers secondary sources i can look for secondary sources for this if youd like also perhaps a bit more concise for example i dont think its really significant that name recognized that illegal drugs remain widely available which is common knowledge cheers,0

names now emc mit and acm are wrong vquaker i am used to accepting correction when it is due but for the life of me i cannot understand why cited information from a primary source name on the fourth factor of authentication is not worth knowing i am confronted with the information that because it is not a legal requirement as far as you know it must be spurious some people know that its better to get their legal information from government sources not wikipedia if you are holding up this resource as some type of cfr or usc guide exposition or sanctioned resource then i believe the us government would like to hear your ideas further someone you know or knows you is part of network administrationwhich is part of the brilliance needing a cohort or supervisor to provide a human factor is difficult to defeat though i suspect you know this already im not offended though just immensely confused as to why this item of access control must be devoid of technical information and meet some arbitrary legal standard i would ask you this if a user loses their smartcard ie cac and forgets their password with the premise being that biometric devices or other inherence factor methodologies are not deployed in most situations does an administrator with knowledge of the user ask they be terminated or do they reissue credentials based on knowing the person there are organizations that will terminate you but i couldnt have said that in my expounding of the 4th factor because it would mean citing information not available to the lay i do hope i can talk without citing what those in df and is would consider common knowledge when we set out it was to provide reliable information if the mission has changed well who could tell consider me a noncontributor from now onwe arent allowed to use wikipedia anyway where i work it is an anathema say what you want unless it surprises someone and then an ego check is issued i should expect nothing less after all i teach what changed the tone was your dumbingdown and use of nonsensical examples that could not be used to authenticate someone name nonsequitur you gave me things to read but im still waiting for you to cite wikipedias policy that information be legally sanctioned and in the format expected by a barrister i cited my sourcewhere is the citation that the language style organization and applicability be inline with one or more regulatory bodies now a better way to be proactive would be to realize that academic databases do you have access to them elsevier name edas ieee springerlink they can be pricey if you try and yet without them youre stuck in a google funk but i digress are full of references to fourth factor that cash register key the manager uses when you return something yep someone you know an thats been around for decades sign up for an account with an isp there it is again take joy in knowing you have some sheriff star and are for the most part helpful i just didnt realize you alone set these standards i repent in ashes and wrend my sackcloth accordingly,0

the definition for fundamental attribution error that is in quotation marks may be bit too much for people unfamiliar with the termspsychology that is included in the definition i would maybe replace words like attributor and add examples after both situational factors and dispositional factors ie situational factors such as luck compared to the fundamental attribution error definition that was provided in quotes the one provided for attribution theory seems more simplistic and easy to follow though social perceiver may have the same problem as attributor did like i mentioned above maybe for both definitions you could only use bits and pieces of the actual quotation and put the rest in your own words ie change social perceiver how an individual would be able to take in information to explain events instead of a in the real world i would use to one instance of this would be in order to have more of an encyclopedic style using their instead of hisher before personality may be better as well followed by in which the individual is interacting instead of heshe is acting this would go well with the next section where individual and their is used in the place of heshe and hisher overall i thought that this was a really interesting article and i think that you did a great job with the explanations and examples i really like the organization of the article and the content seemed accurate aside from the few things that i ve mentioned i think that someone unfamiliar with the topic could get a decent grasp of the subject based on the information that you are presenting,0
mdy dates in centos article hello there ive just the date formatting edits reestablishing mdy dates in centos article so please allow me to explain it a bit further manual of style does say that existing date formats should be kept asis but before i came to edit that article iso dates prevailed and ive changed them to name dates thus i see no problems about moving this time to mdy dates which fwiw i find to be much more readable of course im more than open to discussing this further talk contribs,0

as for the change in romanian to reich yes it is difficult to work out what caldwell is referring to it seems this particular mission was a diversion to the synthetic oil plants in wgermany not polesti raf bomber command used an attack by the 8af to attack this target the days loses were as already given specifically spitfire claims were not discussed so the spitfires percentage of the kill total is unknown which is conveyed in the article more importantly citations have been given for for the order of battle figures your lack of understanding of how any historian presents his work work is palpable oob are given in lists as you should know so your give me a quote tone is rather silly caldwell makes it quit clear that these lists are incomplete with regard to strength returns given he gives known strength returns as for total german day fighter strength again this estimated by caldwell as strength returns for all years are obviously incomplete he points out and totally refutes your claim that the bulk of these machines were deployed against the oilfields in september in the defence of central europe were available for operations at this time while alone were available for combat in the west german fighter units in romania in september were mixed in with eastern front units by june making it impossible to tell just how many fighters were operating in the oil capacity at this time even considering that all ef fighters were at some point deployed in romania they only reach a combined total of compared to a total of plus for the other two fronts negating even the med theatre so your generalisation of a quote if this indeed is what it is makes the bulk of the german fighter force concentrated in romania false,0
xnacional starting it up again i dont want to let things get out of hand again but xnacional immediately started reverting to his preferred and incorrect version when he returned from his block ive restored the consensus version but i doubt this is the end of it from him,0

hunk should have his own page separate from my main argument look the whole talk page is about him also its the fact that he is a playable characterthat separates him from marvin also you can count the fact that he is essentialy to resident evil what chameleon is to mortal combat but he has a story line and background info also look at all of the other separate re character pages all they are is one gigantic filler with nother telling of relationships with other characters or their personality,0

vandalism do not remove appropriate warnings that were placed on your talk page if you continue you will be blocked from editing wikipedia well why dont we quote the text directly fromt the sources i dont see anything wrong with the sources used as the information is backed up by other sources as well for example according to the ny daily news many senior counterterror officials believe the halfdozen uyghurs eyed for release in virginia have troubling ties to an al qaedaaffiliated terror group the turkistan islamic party tip also known as the east turkistan islamic movement most of the uyghurs cleared for release though considered the least dangerous of still at gitmo were suspected operatives of the east turkestan islamic movement the treasury department lists its leader name as a member of name shura council al qaedas board of directors read more c according to name chairman of the xinjiang regional government the fight in guangdong was triggered by the sexual of a female han worker assault by a uygur coworker he said if there are conflicting reports from different sources you should explain and add different opinions for a balanced discussion rather than simply removing others comments,0

it is not a good idea to try to restart this page by blanking the disambiguation page which is rightly titled name and put in an article about this artist if it should be there it should be there at ma artist see wpmosdab if you are unsure about disambiguation pages do not blank this page again,0
look a lenghty exchange of opinions can be a nice thing but since you two have now discussed the rough equivalent of pages this discussion is obviously stalled let me try to sum up what i think about this topic please be aware that wpatt like any other wp policy isn t written in stone and saltyboatrs extremely literal interpretation of one sentence of this policy is most likely not what it was meant to say every article published in foreign affairs is reviewed by other scientists which is much more than you could say for any reliable newspaper or just about every university publication that should be enough to make sure wpatt isn t a good reason to ban them i have to agree with ultramarine if you use your interpretation of wpatt consequently there s only a handful of wparticles that would survive the necessary massdeletion of references what s more i think it would be some pretty bad ones those that rely entirely on newspaper articles finally there really is no good reason why articles that i could use in every political science paper and any scientific article shouldn t be enough for wikipedia,0
i would also like to say that not only are you a masturbate but you are also gay lol,1

problems with article let me seewhat does the article tell us about gamos it is an organisation whether a group of volunteers random nomads or a business is unclear it does though have enabling frameworks with a named uk governmental group the nature of an enabling framework is not specified perhaps it just means financial connections the referenced corporation website ah gamos must be a corporation is filled with similarly nonspecific language why is it notable well apparently because it somehow provoked a multi donor action dealing with african phones one assumes that this sort of provocation is a good thing but this is not quite clear and further it was in some fashion responsible for a good practice paper please someone this article desperately need rewriting it is not really intelligible as it is plus even though some references have been provided to indicate that gamos exists there is very little there to show any significant notability i am replacing the notability tag talk,0

utc this sentence is an editorial opinion and the information about financing is already included being an editorial opinion does not disqualify it per se but taking account the fact that this is an article about the worldwide company with more than years history this opinion about one specific aspect related to the company voiced by nonmainstream magazine will have undue weight it may be relevant in some other article eg focused to the climate change denial financing depending the context january,0

imagine if i treated hapfsjen like you treated this anon editor here we both know his english is poor and his comprehension is poor but when i see his messy edits i leave them alone to avoid conflict but you name you treat people like shit like you i want to delete this article period by period comment in the talk page of an academic and holocaust survivor you dont get to act to like an antisemite and bully people you disagree with and then cry foul when editors point out that you are abusive your actions speak for themselves you first actions as an admin were to impost your pov on a contentious article and you statement that you dont want to block me is a blatant lie you have said just the opposite in the past and participated in accusations of socking to try and get me blocked indefinitely this is on top of our long running conflict so you lie as much as you want and you can block me if i point out the facts that demonstrate youre a liar but bigotry bullying bias prejudice discrimination and other abuses are wrong im limited to how much i can speak out about your actions because perversely speaking out against the worst abuses on wikipedia is punishable but the facts speak for themselves,1
there is no need to do that the source given above speaks explicitly about the cases of the european court of human rights where the occupation of baltic states has been under discussion and thats what this article is about,0

italic textthat said consensus is not simple agreement a handful of editors agreeing on something does not constitute a consensus except in the thinnest sense consensus is a broader process where specific points of article content are considered in terms of the article as a whole and in terms of the articles place in the encyclopedia in the hope that editors will negotiate a reasonable balance between competing views as well as with the practical necessities of writing an encyclopedia and legal and ethical restrictionsitalic text thanks for giving me more proof that im right libs,0

in many cases you are reverting to your version vs multiple users were blocked already for such behavior and were placed under 0rr sanction the so called disruptive editing is on your side since the edits in question are not sourced to mainstream reliable sources are highly biased and in violation to wpnpov core policy to wpterrorist and others also i couldnt see that youre trying to reach consensus in talk pages for your contentious edits ive seen here that you are referring to what you think is my religion and ethnicity which is a clear violation of wikipedias wpagf fundamental principle please refrain from doing so,0

i enjoy lacrosse and i am interested in unc lacrosse history and all the cool facts too you guys have a lot of facts achievements names tournaments and events etc it has been stated already but just make sure to really sort those things out into categories or sections to make the viewer more satisfied to what they are looking at and reading its more of just a blob of information being thrown at me with cool facts thrown in you can separate the tournaments like accs and ncaas and then list what happened or what awards were accepted also maybe you could start off with where lacrosse started or came from or just highlight the word lacrosse with a reference then perhaps inform the reader a bit about the history of unc lacrosse could also have a section of uncs present lacrosse team and their status to really keep the reader up to date with unc lacrosse otherwise keep finding more stories and information about unc lacrosse and be sure to organize and really make it flow all together in addition to that dont forget to reference your sources at the bottom and after information you have found along with access dates and names etc keep it up and it will all come together great im sure unc lax get er done,0

the spelling tacarimba la tumba del fuego santa maliga sacategas lo onto del sol y cruz is the one stated in the lyrics in the vocal score of side by side by name available for rental only this version of the song however misspells name pg presumably to approximate the pronunciation and has the lyric todays the last ill be spreading rather than spending it would seem therefore that this source cannot be considered canonical this rendering of the place name does accord with name recording on the side by side by name cast album however the published version of the song as contained in the hansen treasury of stephen name songs name has the lyric printed as tacarembo la tumbe del fuego santa malipas zacatecas la junta del sol y cruz and being a printed source as opposed to handwritten as is the vocal score can presumably be considered definitive name pronunciation on the original cast recording of the mad show for which the song was written follows this spelling which would suggest that the printed version is correct as it is a fictional place name however any discussion of correct spellingpronunciation is an academic one at best,0

misleading reference to study in the section on lead paint in art which i largely wrote someone added the following lead paint will often become discolored over long periods of time this is due to the reaction of the lead carbonate in the paint with traces of hydrogen sulfide in the air and with acids often from fingerprints as a result many older works of art that used lead paint now show some discoloration as i found this surprising i went and carefully read the study being cited their research seemed to refer only to lead in aqueous media on paper although that wasnt absolutely clear but lead paint is almost never used that way artists working in transparent watercolor aquarelle dont usually use white paint or just occasionally a bit of chinese white not lead to make corrections and opaque watercolors gouache and acrylic polymer artists paints typically use titanium dioxide or rarely zinc white but never lead normally flake white is used only by oil painters and theres no indication in the study that they were referring to oil paints cooperstown is a wellrespected institution but as of now im sticking with the classic name flake white may get slightly yellowish after centuries but nothing like the gross discoloration referred to in the paragraph above if someone has more information on this please mention it here otherwise when i come back im going to delete that paragraph or water it down no pun intended,0

just my thoughts on iti doubt there is a definitive answer that would satisfy everyone and doubt that it is worth he effort to try to clarify in any great detail in some cases it is probably appropriate and actually used just like a surname in a legitimate but different broader sense than that used by our surname article and including patronymics in iceland or elsewhere by the person thats probably especially true of radio personalities with an onair name that is actually two given names but sounds like a given name and a last name ive seen that happen quite often and that happens with various other stage names and pen names that are derived from given names but as a general rule no some like name make it clear by normally using a hyphen the problem of course is that our articles especially the stubs and substubs often do not have enough information to make it clear what is going on if it is name or something of the sort common combinations of given names where the second one is much rarer as a surname especially if it includes the actual surname in the article itself it should clearly be under m in any category the redirect which should be there or a dummy one if needed because otherwise it would be a disambiguation page could be categorized if the full name were desired in some categories and when that is done a note on the article page is helpful but in between there is a huge variety that youll likely get some arguments about no matter how it is done a bigger problem is people with full names given in the article name yet indexed under just the first given name in all categories and there are lots of them even worse are those easter egg sortings under some nickname which doesnt even appear in the articles own name,0
adding to this since its now over yeah never once was tb called this name in fact from the last few chaps of this arc the name seemed to be the best name you could use to call names late crew who are dead so names and name are two different crews,0

thanks for everything youve done in this matter i have a fear that the user may come back with another account in the future to harass me some more so although the disruption is over id just like to state that here when a user creates an account simply to make gross accusations about other users and call them the worst thing possible then yes i get a bit worried about it unfortunately and worried that it has a possibility of happening again hopefully its all over but i just wanted this written somewhere so people could see this and my reasoning if it ever happens again thanks again,0

deletion of name page wondering why is was necessary to delete the page on name an educator of vegan practices and animal rights i see that your comment on the reason for deletion was the only thing he is known for is being fired however that is not the case in the animal friendly vegetarian vegan community in fact he is praised by many for his passion in properly educating children about the origins of their food why would you find it so crucial to speedy delete a page that simply speaks of cruelty free living and aims to educate people on the truth about their food is that information threatening to wikipedia for some reason and i wouldnt think as a wiki admin that your opinion on the topic is reason enough to control what info is available and what is deleted you may know mr name as only being fired but being the intelligent science studying individual that you are surly you must realize that his efforts to educate children and promote compassion for animals is actually very honorable and deserving of recognition please show a little compassion yourself and undelete the page,0

yeah they really exist you need at least one w one fa from that class and one w one from that class and you can make the others from them a few carnivores species need more essential fatty acid deficiency was first seen in people getting total intravenous nutrition where for obvious reasons they put in only amino acids sugar vitamins and minerals fat emulsions were quite hard to develop as iv formulas the reason for the problem is that the body can make facts but cannot introduce unsaturation closer to the end than w and you need w and w fatty acids to make lipids the w dha is your most common neural tissue fat ill see what i can do to put in some general refs from academic nutrition books there is some quackery out there like pills that contain w because olive oil is cheap but most of the fish oil supplements are worth taking actually unless you eat cold water ocean fish regularly btw there is some evidence that that bad reputation of saturated fats are from experiments in which animals were fed only hydrogenated coconut oil for their fat source this destroys all essential fatty acids because it destroys all pufas on such a diet even dogs get severe atherosclerosis and they are species highly resistant to it their hdls are higher than their ldls so all this is quite fascinating,0

while i agree that indus valley civilisation is the correct name for the civilisation the passage quoted above is not neccecarily factual in terms of saying second there is no proof at all that the mighty sarasvati of the name was in fact this now dry river the identification is itself open to doubt apart from there being factsproof to indicate that saraswati did exist as this dry river including geological facts as to why it dried up the evidence also points to the fact that it was not a tributary of the indus refuting point of the passage quoted above and in fact drew the waters of the sutlej and the yamuna to be a river system of its own and though a large number of sites have been found along this river system none of them are of the scale of harrapa mohenjodaro leaving the indus valley tag as the correct one saraswati did existtoday the timing is disputed and not the existence name it is vedic and name name and non vedic is more disputed today than its existence,0
my reply that you have deleted in a fascist manner from the nicosia discussion pagel nicosia and discrimination against greek contributors and the greek character of the citydear name you have accused me of abusive behaviour against other users and consequently blocked me from editing the article on nicosia for a hour period may i draw to your attention that it is fairly obvious that those three users namely seb az86556 seric2 and chesdovi are clearly constantly creating a picture of nicosia as a decadent muslim city that serves their religious beliefs and are all clearly hailing form turkish backgrounds there is a constant undermining of the city s greek identity ie whenever a greek flag appears in any single picture the aforementioned users delete that picture instantaneously and prefer to throw in pictures of the flag of shame and occupation that is equivalent to a legalisation of a human crime of continuous brutal occupation of the island of cyprus by the turkish army the greek flag is omnipresent in the republic of cyprus whether some people like it or detest it but this is the reality and an encyclopedia that wishes to be unbiased should depict the reality and not the subjective views of a minority of readers that are furthermore based on extremist religious and nationalistic views on the other hand such users do find it appropriate to throw in pictures using the turkish and the illegal yes illegal according to united nation referendums flat of the nonrecognised internationally illegal selfproclaimed state of the socalled trnc it is totally unacceptable to have extremist nationalistic individuals that strategically reached the level of administrators deteriorating all the time the article on the city of nicosia promoting an unrealistic turkish character and undermining the greek character of the city and at the same time having an additional article on north nicosia that is depicting a totally false picture wrt the city the trnc is illegal not recognised by any state other than turkey and some terrorist states that are nondemocratic and yet wikipedia has a page on northern nicosia by supposedly administrators that support the unification of cyprus this is clearly a major distortion of their intentions and a huge lie in that an individual that pretends to be a neutral aribtrator and a supoporter of reunification cannot have a separate page on northern nicosia stressing how turkish it is and then go and literally destroy everything in the proper page for nicosia and emphasize the turkish character of the city talk about the tension and the division of the city all the time and undermine the greek character this is clear nationalistic and racial discrimination against the indisputable greek character of the area controlled by the republic of cyprus and furthermore it is downgrading for the republic of cyprus the mere fact that wikipedia has a site that is constantly vandalised by several ethnic turkish extremists and wikipedia users support such discriminatory behaviour in the light of all of this i shall stop contributing to wikipedia as i consider it downgrading for my own self furthermore i do not wish to participate in an encyclopedic project that is totally biased and discriminatory marcobadotti talk,0

as posted at regarding a suggested wikipedia regrets the errors regarding the according to format for information cited regarding mediation this most recent fantasy oriented post is emblematic of a large part of the reason why i requested this user be blocked in addition to generally incorrect and inappropriate edits to the nccc article all around its pretty apparent that we are dealing with a fairly severe personality disorder you can start from square one with all of the patience and good faith that many of us have already extended and expended but weve tried that see discussion log and its utterly pointless ill renew my call for a permanent user and ip range block loverofart coterminous youre right about one thing theres not a snowballs chance in hell of anything like that being published by this encyclopedia and certainly not under my signature administrators are not empowered to make statements such as you suggest and i assure you that they are out of the norm for the project i encourage you for the final time to take advantage of the dispute resolution procedures beginning with mediation if you do not accept mediation other steps will have to be taken name talk ugly personal attacks you approve good morning name the post above yours by loverofart is typical of his posts in my direction an ugly personal attack by a person who has in essence defamed a widely respected organization the national civilian community corps by posting false and misleading information at the wikipedia website if your wikipedias best idea is that what should happen next is that i enter into a prolonged dialogue with that person hoping to reason with himher while heshe continues to exert control over content and issue ugly diatribes then your processes leave a great deal to be desired a responsible adult a real editor should have interceded long ago heshe and the others working over the nccc text at this time seem to feel that any statement introduced by the phrase according to does not belong at wikipedia as i read it there was objection at one of your pages to placing references at the end of that phrase rather than at the end of the quotation why an encyclopedia would have as a policy including bald claims as if fact without reference to the source in its text eludes me it would give the impression that the encyclopedia had evaluated the statement which is obviously not the case i appreciate wikipedias effort to provide freely accessible information to the public i am not impressed however by the response to gross errors made at the wikipedia site your crew is attacking the messenger at least in part because it is the message that it does not like a pretty sorry performance which you seem to be joining by failing to address the issues i raise or the attacks on me pull loverofart out of this situation and i will join in a dispute resolution process regarding editing the nccc site i refuse to have further dealings with himhercoterminous,0

speedy deletion of vanilla french band a tag has been placed on vanilla french band requesting that it be speedily deleted from wikipedia this has been done under section a7 of the criteria for speedy deletion because the article appears to be about a band but it does not indicate how or why the subject is notable that is why an article about that subject should be included in an encyclopedia under the criteria for speedy deletion articles that do not indicate the subjects importance or significance may be deleted at any time please see the guidelines for what is generally accepted as notable as well as our subjectspecific notability guideline for musical topics if you think that this notice was placed here in error you may contest the deletion by adding to the top of the page that has been nominated for deletion just below the existing speedy deletion or db tag coupled with adding a note on the talk page explaining your position but be aware that once tagged for speedy deletion if the article meets the criterion it may be deleted without delay please do not remove the speedy deletion tag yourself but dont hesitate to add information to the article that would would render it more in conformance with wikipedias policies and guidelines lastly please note that if the article does get deleted you can contact one of these admins to request that a copy be emailed to you,0
grouping khoikhoi has been adding this tabthe turks of turkey can be broken down into a variety of segments and the majority of selfidentifying turks include four main groupings name who are mostly of balkan origin name who compose the bulk of ethnic turks found in anatolia see history section central asian turks who remain a large segment of the population that has been moving to turkey for centuries and name from russia and the caucasus such as the tatars and name who have more recent ties with turkic peoples these turks share similar languages and cultures which is not true because according to it the large segment of the population should be from central asia but its not true they should be included in the name because noone in turkey has recent ties with central asia other than tatarsetc which are already explained below as name so it makes groupings,0
words of encouragement to user name in the cases of dispute with the users engaged in bulgarian nationalistic propaganda name you have come to the same conclusions about bulgarian 19th century nationalistic propaganda on english wikipedia userlaveol is one of the most prominent editors on wikipedia contributing false information in the articles about republic of macedonia name and what else not he is spending a lot of time working on his cause pushing bulgarian nature in the articles of the domain of republic of macedonia how far has he gone in pushing this propaganda you can see at wikipediawikiprojectromacedonia where he has listed himself as a member so just my few words of concern for the macedonian articles in english wikipedia and the great damage done by userlaveol and other users with the bulgarian and antimacedonian propaganda hopefully with the internet access becoming more affordable to the people in republic of macedonia the things will go in right direction removing the bulgarian propaganda from macedonian articles cleaning them of false fabricated information and giving the facts to the world and the views of the macedonian science and sources i dont have much time now but hopefully will be able to find some more in the coming period i am open to any collaborationeffort for the above goals i am expecting that this user laveol will continue with the bulgarian nationalistic propaganda and polluting the domains in the domain of republic of macedonia simply because he is able to and can find a ways to continue to work on his agenda name is to try to remove these false claims and contribute the facts about the macedonia name name i hope you write something here at least to show that usertalkname and usertalkname is not the same user some insight into my user name name the only user i am using to contribute to wikipedia is name it is composed of the first letter of my name emil and my last name janev user name is a separate user probably that user name is comming from dame a macedonian first name and mk or the code of republic of macedonia it does happen that i am from canada i was born in republic of macedonia and have lived there until i moved to usa first and canada before more than years and yes having all the false information from the bulgarian nationalistic propaganda originating from the 19th century and having it into 21st century to be used to negate the macedonian nation and all its attributes by users as laveol is the reason of some of my editing actions in wikipedia i am not the only usereditor from republic of macedonia or with macedonian origin that has the same views for this bulgarian nationalistic propaganda that already is infiltrated in the macedonian articles you can watch the contributions of specialcontributionslaveol and see that more than of his actions are engagement in negating the macedonian nation and its attributes,0

the primary mission as you call it of wikipedia should not be to obfuscate the truth and promote official dogma by labeling every idea that the establishment doesnt like as fringe i dont see anything in your or names claims that is any more enlightened or courageous or intelligent than the abuse and nonsense thrown at galileo by the vatican you have your official truth supported by argument from authority illogic and everything else is conspiracy theories that are automatically suspect,0

name the article name has been speedily deleted from wikipedia this was done because the article seemed to be about a person group of people band club company or web content but it did not indicate how or why the subject is notable that is why an article about that subject should be included in wikipedia under the criteria for speedy deletion articles that do not assert notability may be deleted at any time if you can indicate why the subject is really notable you are free to recreate the article making sure to cite any verifiable sources please see the guidelines for what is generally accepted as notable and for specific types of articles you may want to check out our criteria for biographies for web sites for bands or for companies feel free to leave a note on my talk page if you have any questions about this talk to me,0

and re the matter at hand i agree and rs seems to support that megavitamin therapy is used by practitioners of orthomolecular medicine not the other way around unless theres solid rs showing that mvt is generally defined as or equated with om i dont see any reason to mention it in the introductory sentence or conflate the terms ill certainly concede that its widely used as are megamineral megaamino mega therapies and will gladly stipulate to its inclusion in the opening section but i cant see my way beyond that any thoughtssuggestions anyone,0

looks good to me at the moment i dont think we need to mention feral cats i doubt that it is common for feral cats to enter a house via a cat flap on the whole cats are uncomfortable with entering anothers territory although i imagine it does happen occaisionally especially if a feral cat learns that there might find food inside if someone can find a useful reference on the subject we could readd it mind you i did once find a wood pigeon tapping at my girlfriends cat flap which seemed particularly unwise,0

please refrain from making personal comments you know better than that name being an owner of the hendon mob site has nothing whatever to do with your incorrect conclusionjumping about the site you were wrong and you should have done some research before you made several mistatements in contrast if you would have said a site owned by the person being profiled should be avoided as a reference if possible you would have made a valid point and one that is easily dealt with since there are similar sites that could be cited instead still your own point makes no sense since there is obviously independent corroboration and many reliable sources cite it but again that was not the point here you should do minimal factual research before making inaccurate assertions about blatantly obvious reliable sources you do seem to have moved on from that now even if you havent admitted the error so we can just move on past this,0

please remain civil you may have a personal relationship with the subject or have personal reasons for supporting him but taking personal offence on his behalf isnt useful to improvement of the article you keep conflating my changes with those of someone else the use of the word caused appears to be the major source of your dudgeon and i didnt make that change you keep reverting all changes wholesale including changes made for reasons purely of style rather than picking out the ones which are bothering you we have no proof that the documents are sensitive or that bradley name is responsible for anything at all since there has been no legal action you complain about blp but accepting claims about bradley names guilt in the matter of a serious criminal offence are an extremely serious blp policy violation until the claims of lamo and the us government have been established in a court of law we cannot use the wordofgod to state their claims are true as for the torture citation if you read the article and many others also easily obtainable you will see that its the newspaper which chose to put torture in quotation marks not the experts they consulted we are not interested in the editorial opinion of the newspaper but rather the opinion of the experts whom the newspaper has consulted who clearly states that names treatment amounts to torture,0
ec perhaps your motives are entirely honourable but that seems to be a major departure from the current structure this article has been a featured article and so consensus reached among many editors is very firmly against you,0

the edit you pointed out as a supposed example of povpushing was not povpushing at all i removed a reference to name running in the republican primary against name i removed it because there were two other references to stockmans primary challenge to cornyn already in the article also in the next edit that i did i added a better reference for the primary run i was the editor that put the original reference to the primary challenge in the cornyn article in the first place see if it baldfaced lies like that one that you just wrote here that get in trouble you are a pov warrior in the first order you attempt to slander people that dont agree with your editingjust like you are attempting to do here to me you have zero evidence for allegationsjust made up baldfaced lies i am not in seattle and i am a sock of either of those people i am not a sock of anyone you edit in bad faith and the way that you have been treating me in an example of your bad faith editing i dont have anything to be concerned about in relation to your sock allegation ive known that all along i said it before you did i did not need you to tell me your apologies are out right lies also because when you apologize you come up with five or six more allegations against whomever you are apologizing to all of your apologies are fraudulent just like your sock allegations please just stop responding to me because youre fake apologies just embarrass you further and make you look worst stop it go away,0

sock puppetry is using any account whatsoever considered sock puppetry this site is a complete joke i cant even edit using a verifiable account without being accused of violating some concocted offense my address was censored because i was using an account which was apparently improperly named so i am now using one that is properly named after the probation period and that in and of itself is apparently an offense logically what is going on is that i am being unable to contribute in any way whatsoever because i am being repeatedly punished for a first offense spawned from ignorance what kind of site are you people trying to run here its no wonder the main founder of wikipedia turned his back on it when its become such a blatant travesty of the intellectual honesty it purports to espouse i have continuously been censored for editing a biased article an article which is continuously edited by selfavowed marxists and antizionists the very same people whose pov the article unashamedly puts forward what kind of encyclopedia has articles that put forward opinion verified by echo chamber sources if any editor attempted to put that sort of trash in britannica they would be quickly disassociated with the publication but its quite apparent that wikipedia has no controls whatsoever and has chosen to let the patients run the asylum there is no use in attempting to run an objective and educational publication when the very people who have discredited the internet as a source of information are allowed to manipulate the site by sourcing the same intellectually dishonest sites that people use wikipedia to avoid in short explain yourselves particularly name who has manipulated his position on this site to censor any points he disagrees with all without explaining why when you stop accepting the ridiculous assumption that senior members are beyond reproach perhaps the site will gain some semblance of credibility as it stands wikipedia is just another example persistence winning over intelligence,0
reverting to last known edit by me the article was vandalized a few days ago and is now being returned to its original state any users wishing to dispute the information should do so here if sysops examine the network log files they will discover that the vast majority of referers come from truth sites and the vast majority of exit links go to truth sites therefore removing that information was damaging wikipedias reputation visitors are depending on wikipedia to cover the work that name is currently involved in which of course includes everything relating to that was on that page using the ct term to describe theories is ad hominem and also not npov and therefore not civil anyone endorsing that type of thinking is not npov and ask them to not edit the pages as the zogby poll shows of america believes the government is covering up and want a new investigation including government officials possibly being involved for now on any vandalism or ad hominem remarks will be dealt with via official complaints using wikipedia protocol also even though my ad hominem remarks were direct retaliation i do apologize for them anyone using these types of remarks should not be editing these pages i expect anyone and everyone to be civil,0

investigating is one thing but escalating to a block when none was requested doesnt seem appropriate it is proper to issue a complaint about a conflict of interest when you believe there to be one and not appropriate to be blocked for doing so the first edit listed is definitely not edit warring as that was the first time that statement was added there is nothing vague about a wp3rr warning i believe this is even required by wikipedia policy again we have a conflict of interest if parties on one side of a material dispute engage in blocking parties on the other side for whatever reason they give,0

can you please try to see the glass being half full instead of half empty im certainly not trying to do anything that you or others would see as problematic five weeks ago i was getting involved in wikipedia and i was feeling enthusiastic so i posted something to some user groups reaching members encouraging them to contribute to wikipedia i thought at the time that longtime wikipedia people would be more welcoming of new people and that wikipedians would be happy that i encouraged others to participate i was not trying to target and encourage employees of a commercial product to contribute the groups i posted to were user groups not employee groups but yes i guess that some employees belong to these groups as well and my comment about hill using the talk page was simply to comment that my personal pov is that he found a good way for someone with coi to contribute i feel that the negative and accusing tone of your last sentence is unwarranted it is unwelcoming comments like that that drive away new wikipedia contributors i see my wikipedia contributions as a way of giving unselfishly to the world trying to spread knowledge and improve understanding i think that even if i only have time to make a small number of contributions i feel i am helping and that this should be the spirit of wikipedia so seeing your criticism that i am not making enough edits to noncommercial products is just frustrating and disheartening to me i hate feeling that i have to defend my reputation here and i dont agree with you that editing noncommercial pages should improve anyones appearance of trustworthiness however your claim that i am only editing the wikipedia entries of these commercial products is also just incorrect i dont know if there is a way to view the wikipedia contributions of others but if there is you would see that ive been making edits to many noncommercial pages including crispdm data mining the journal data mining and knowledge discovery predictive analytics statistics customer retention predictive model markup language anomaly detection semma machine learning name sigkdd decision tree learning sometimes im making simple formatting edits and sometimes im spending hours trying to track down the right references to put on the crispdm page yes my edits are mostly in the general area of data mining because that is where i have the greatest interest and knowledge similarly when i guest lecture at local universities i lecture to these types of classes not due to any collusion but because thats what i know thanks for listening to my minirant i know im taking this more personally than you probably meant it but it bothers me when someone questions that i am not working hard enough or they question my ethics and thats what your comments feel like all im asking is that longestablished wikipedia people be more welcoming and encouraging and give new people the benefit of the doubt that they are acting in good faith trying to make meaningful contributions however small new people grow and adjust but it takes a while to learn the conventions of the wikipedia community please be patient and encouraging to new people im going to leave this discussion now if needed i will return to it after the holiday season but i hope there is no need to,0

exactly name knew what color her eyes were when she made the song behind these name comparing the pictures of name and name they do seem to share the same eye color just slightly different shades of it names eyes are little lighter someone made a video called behind names name the person who made this video knew what color names eyes were and decided to include names name in the title and if you read the comments the people fully agree her eyes are hazel with comments like green or hazel they look more hazel than brown or green yup belles eyes are deffinetely hazel problem solved i like the problem solved part with names bias against the idea of name having hazel eyes i think there will always be a problem with people like her involved tv tropes has already suffered an edit war because of her so much so they forbade users from writting what names eye color is notice how names name is missing from the eye color tropes colony while the rest of disney princesses have their eye color mentioned names name was there under the category of name until name came along and ruined it all same thing almost happened to name this is names account as you can see she got blocked with an expiry time of infinite the reason inserting false information the false information being writting down names eyes as brown and now heres name on the wikipedia is there any repsite from her i noticed she has a live journal account see what she has written the lack of links speaks for itself she thinks she actually proved names eyes are brown depsite the fact what she has presented as evidence is either a minority or a plain old lie like the screenshots she send me by magnifying the images you can see her eyes are hazelcolored and not the same color as her hair at all notice how shes afriad to use closeups of names eye cuz she knows theyll appear hazel if she did so thus disproving her on her blog she didnt mention that she was blocked on name and said the only reason name kept names eyes color as hazel was to shut up people who keep writting her eyes as hazel when in reality the one who got shut up was name as she got blocked while the others didnt she wrote name kids these days this one needs a hobby im tired of wasting time trying to undo this snots damage and im fairly sure the mods of these sites are too would it be possible to justblock this person off the internet entirely until they learn some manners yup she calls people who use logic and legitimate evidence to prove their point snots and hobbyless kids if the evidence goes against what name saidbelieves if anyone deserves to be blocked its name if it wasnt for her bias sites like like tv tropes name and the wikipedia wouldnt have suffered an edit war about names eye color the fact that there was never an edit about names eye color until name came along says a lot ever since she got blocked from name almost an year ago no edit war about names eye color happened there either its like name is the only person on the entire internet who refuses to accept names eyes as hazel and is willing to go to every page and change her eye color to brown just cuz she likes to think so not because the world thinks so or any legit evidence are presented its like someone going around changing names eyes from blue to green just cuz he likes the idea of name being greeneyed thinks dont work like that my overall opinion on minotaurgurl i think its safe to say the interent is better off without her shes toxic shes a nuisance shes talks trash to people just cuz they disagree with her she lies she mangles twists and misrepresents other peoples words and she causes edit wars action needs to be taken against people like this,0
my statement oh wow i take a little drive and come back to a nuclear war zone i guess i can take on each point the fact that name was not blocked for the same behavior is rather odd also if you ask a question after telling me to stop replying what do you really expect i agree that name needed to be blocked and i agree with the desysopping to say that i have no right to be angry is a foolhardy notion i was told multiple times to fuck off btw when told to fuck off i am considerably less likely to comply they both hail from the infamous tiscali network that being said rpeh has no reason to be involved in this discussion he has a personal issue with me ever since he was desysopped on another wiki he hasnt gotten over it i intend to request a checkuser and request a block for sockpuppetry username places too much weight on unofficial warnings a vandal can be warned four times but a user once hmmmm prodego has no reason to be desysopped he had every right to block for a violation of wpnpa tens of times talk,0

ufc afds those were never transcluded to the name page so theres probably not a lot of point them existing im a bit pushed for time today so if you want to remove the name banners from the articles ill delete the name pages when i get the chance i havent been able to spend much time on wikipedia lately looks like theyve been officially listed as names ill leave them alone for now name ive only nominated a few very obvious mma people before name was deleted via name discussion a speedy delete on grounds of it being deleted before was denied to me he still fails wpmmanot but im in no way a mma expert what do you think at first glance it appears that name hasnt fought at the highest level of mma as required by wpathlete or whatever the guideline is these days and wpmmanot if i had an interest in having the article removed i would name it again hello it has been brought to my attention from an outside source about this discussion can i first point out that name is a former ucmma middleweight champion and currently the ucmma welterweight champion ucmma is along with bamma and cage warriors the biggest mma promotion in the united kingdom secondly after glancing over wpmmanot and wpathlete i see that they are indeed guidelines now i may be cut from a different cloth from you two in terms of how we see what a guideline is but to me a guideline is optional when it comes to following it meaning that they cannot be used in names as the sole reason why to delete any article thirdly i have spent much time working on the page as well as being the creator of the page i have found very strong sources from websites such as the sun the mirror as well as finding information that goes beyond it from being a typical mixed martial artists wikipedia page as it has information about him being on a reality tv show called party wars and being the headline of an article in which he got into issues with the police for his tactics whilst working as a wheel clamper only strengthens his notability the very sources on him alone helps him pass wpgng which is all you need to pass a page on wikipedia in my opinion i would welcome constructive ideas about improving the page even more but to talk about deleting the page without informing me first of this discussion i find is a bit disrespectful towards me however i fairness to you we havent exactly known each other for a while so now i have adding myself to the topic and given the facts of the pages position on wikipedia now we can talk to help improve the page even more userpound4pound since you filed the spi i wanted to update you that ive reversed the block i requested another editor to review the case and while there are a lot of coincidences he felt it was borderline enough based on behavior that the block should be reversed and instead just monitor the situation i had some reservations going into the block but it seemed likely however i fully respect the review and would ask we all give the benefit of the doubt in this case i completely see why you reported it i did block after all so there is no question as to your faith here just wanted to update you join wer alpha chi national honor society copyright i made changes and enhancements to the alpha chi national college honor society page including citations to sources the director of operations contacted wikipedia granting permission for material from the website to be used by wikipedia she received a reply indicating that it was safe to move forward with the edits nearly a month later you removed the edits is there something im missing here a copy of the email sent to wikipedia and the reply dear lara noah thank you for your email our response follows your message lara,0

rajputs not rajasthanisright p prof names studies mention that the romani people are most closely related to the punjabis and rajputs im pretty sure not rajasthanis he calls protoromani rajputic the distinction is important if they are partly descended from rajputs who were never really confined to any one part of india that would explain the linguistic variation within the indic words in romani for example why the use of o instead of aa at the end of masculine nounsadjectives in romani this is certainly a characteristic of gujarati and name but is it a characteristic of rajasthani languages anyway if im wrong in making the last change i made as of now ill be happy to revert it myself oh of course,0

hi name no you are not in any way one of the people i was talking about you just got caught in the crossfire and if i made you think i was thinking of you i apologise your work is consistent good plus even more importantly you have a sensitivity to other peoples work with a few people dont you build on their work to produce something that improves in quality the people i was talking about arrive at an article chop it around change meanings change context spelling capitalisation and then move on more often than not without giving the slightest suggestion that they actually knew what they were doing for example one guy when he comes across the word taoisigh which is the gaelic plural for taoiseach and which is explained as such on its first mention in some articles frequently changes it to taoiseachs a nonexistent word he has tried to change governorsgeneral to governorgenerals prime minister to prime minister he changed links from president of ireland to president of ireland links to the united kingdom of great britain and ireland ie the form of uk between and to united kingdom of great britain and ireland so linking the reference to the wrong uk he mucked up some links to name deputy irish prime minister by lowercasing it changed a series of mentions of first lady when referring to a specific first lady to lowercase first lady changed one mention of name to name removed the word g from gear id og fitzgerald and m r from name not grasping that they actually were two different people m r big in gaelic and indicated the father g meaning small meant his son and ended up turning an article that mentioned them both into gobbledigook that is just some of my work he has mucked up he made a complete mess of some biology articles reduced an article on medi val history to such a degree of unreadability that the author one of the worlds top medi val historians quick wiki in disgust i know at least six people who have left wiki over his actions and there are quite a few such people not a lot but enough to mangle everything they touch another contributor constantly changed an elementary fact in 18th century history on the basis of google searches i checked on google the majority of articles said he was right those google searches turned up stuff that were barely of high school standard but she treated google as sacrosanct if a google search said it it was gospel i have had political science articles which i have written and which were based on hard fact in mediocre garbage applying wrong capitalisation again based on google searches that largely threw up high school essays wrong spelling wrong interpretation etc i wasnt reacting simply to the droop quota at all that was the sixth article that day i had done that had been hit in that case name as he is prone to do swept in to a topic he knows little about changed capitalisation text and even the formula which is the standard dq formula taught in that form because as already happened in the discussion on the talk page if you leave out the parentheses people muck up the order of the calculation and so get the wrong formula that intervention was classic name go onto a page about a topic he doesnt know much about and instead of asking why it is written like that unilaterally change it in most cases producing a version that is so wrong it would be savaged if any student repeated it in a class american english and british english use different approaches to capitalisation many of the references were to things only found outside the us and so capitalised instead he insisted on applying us capitalisation rules to things whose capitalisation is a result of their existence and usage in parts of the world outside the us that indeed is one of the reasons why google should never be used in checking capitalisation apart from its general unreliability most website mentions in the us are created by people who automatically and incorrectly apply us capitalisation to things that dont exist in the us and are capitalised internationally a classic example is the electoral system prstv proportional representation using the single transferable vote name insisted on lowercasing it on the basis on a google search prstv isnt used in the us and is generally capitalised when referring to the specific voting system and lowercased when used generically where it is mentioned on google it is largely on the basis of americans writing about it and downcasing it to suit american english so name unilaterally mucked up the capitalisation then another us user moved the page to another name that refers to a somewhat similar but not the same electoral system more widely known in the us so any nonamerican user would get r,0

show n tell a question for it may seem an odd question to wp purists but considering the importance wp places on reliability of secondary sources why does wp not require a same or similar vetting process of its editors particularly those who seem to speak only for themselves the entire concept of requiring contributors to discussargue with a username is absurd in its most basic interpretation for all i know i could be spinning my wheels fighting for accuracy with a demented mind gameplaying geek living in inner mongolia it is imperative in my mind that those who demand respect offer up some sort of evidence as i have of their actual ability credibility reliability accountability their authority to control if its required of the sources it should certainly be required of those who quote them and write about them similarly how do i call for consensus who may be a member and how is each identified thanks in advance thats the beauty of wikipedia anyone can edit it thats the point you have no more authority than any other editor here regardless of your credentials also anyone can participate when trying to achieve consensus just remember its not the number of people but the strength or the arguments that matter name,0

hello deacon thanks for the kind words your wording is better regarding territory but i think that it still might specifically mention the firth of clyde since northumbria ruled the area south of it for a while how about between the humber and the firths of clyde and forth or similar but theres no great preference here either way oswiu chose the roman way at whitby in and he died in thereafter there was a steady erosion of ionabased clerics in northumbrian territory quite noticeable by pehthelms consecration in the 8th century have a look at the name reference i cite which suggests that both picts and northumbrians were working in concert in the early 8th century towards the roman way in preference to the columban way it looks like a political process constant and steady but not a sudden forcible ouster the end result was indeed a facilitation of northumbrian hegemony northumbrias fortunes were upanddown in the 7th century regarding its southern neighbors particularly name and that is not to suggest that anyone chose name preferences over bernician ones im aware of the substantial history of ionabased clerics in bernicia but times change and sometimes political entities do things for expedient reasons the translation of pehthelms name without stated authority is indeed sourced the claim is made flatout so have a look at the reference cited i tried to make sure that anyone who likes to check out references can do so easily indeed you should be able to quickly access every citation that i made in the article regards,0
skookum1 2nd note about the above theres situations again with somena mentioned elsewhere where the people and government are somewhat indeterminate and well as indistinguishable in the somenas case because theyre not a legal government but one of the ancient social divisions of the peoples of the cowichan valley what we might call a chieftaincy but thats an imposed concept if you read the somena page youll see what i meani think bottom line is frankly were imposing a rational order based on our concepts separate concepts of ethnicity language and government in some first nations culture thats a lot harder to do so the somena are not a first nations government in the white mans way of thinking or even in the thinking of the union of bc indian chiefs which is an organization of whitemansystem band governments and tribal councils created by the indian act the reserve system and government agents et al but it would be touchy to exclude the somena from equal status in a template say with their neighbourskin the quamichan all too confusing for a cultus whiteman at this hour of the night so im going to bed now,0

football player statistics hi name and thanks for your message of course the information youve been adding to footballers pages is accurate but here at wikipedia there is a convention to summarise league competition only in the infobox where you see it at the top while cups and european competitions are generally displayed much further down the page no one is suggesting you are adding bad data but please bear the above in mind when making future edits thanks a lot for your contributions so far and we look forward to seeing many more of them,0

again i disagree scholarly consensus has been moving towards the direction of inclusiveness particularly for the question of the roma and the disable in fact as you go through modern academic literature the last years holocaust more and more includes nonjewish victims just an example name from york university the holocaust isfor good reasons i need not rehearse heregenerally held to be the most extreme case of human evil all the different kinds of domination fused together in auschwitzracism directed at jews name and roma the economic exploitation of slave labour the oppression of gays and women the persecution of dissenting minorities such as communists and names witnesses or name identity building and the holocaust roma political nationalism i have already mentioned name who was a senior historian at the research institute of the us holocaust memorial museum and name a leading holocaust historian in the usa is another important voice this increasing consensus has had an impact on common language as well on political bodies see this press release from the un for instance it is not a question of ranking victimsit is the concept of hte holocaust as a racist mordern project and the common fate of the victims the famous pictures of names twins are of roma children the technology and expertise for mass murder was developed for the disable in the t4 the tactics of eisengruppen were first developed in the invasion of poland against polish leaders i have seen several good arguments that convinced me of the centrality of jews in the holocaust i have never seen a convincing argument for their exclusivity if this is not enough let me try in another way by deciding to describe the holocaust as an exclusive jewish event wikipedia is taking sides in a ongoing scholarly debate i could say on the declining side of an ongoing scholarly debate this is not holocaust denial with no legitimacy in the academia and it must receive more than mere lip service in the body of the text or in the footnotes at very least wikipedia must admit the existence of debate in the lead,0

respectfully bells theorem is not empirical evidence it is not compelling to me and it is disputed as a proof i have not seen any compelling evidence that name was wrong about his criticism of quantum mechanics he did not say it was not an outstanding and extremely successful model he just said some of the theory behind it can not be correct the theory is incomplete name was a cocky nazi scientist who was badly off in his calculations related to abomb creation and i don t know why people wish to believe what they don t them selves comprehend it escapes me and lessens my faith in their judgment,0

we have a color for altaic just as we have a color for other nongenetic groups such as papuan and american in order to keep the number of colors at a manageable level but most linguists have never been convinced of the validity of altaic as a genetic group and the majority of linguistics simply view it as a sprachbund i doubt that further research will reveal anything more convincing the notion of altaic has been around for something or more years and has failed to convince the majority of historical linguists in that time its not like were dealing with unknown languages and simply lack enough data altaic is likely never to be demonstrated to be a valid genetic grouping,0

october utc this is a nontrivial problem many perhaps most of the editors with the highest edit count are likely to have diverse editing habits i can think of two fa writers in that group one who also has an awful lot of categorisation edits another spends a lot of time on awb any analysis of those would need to work out the proportion of their edits that were of various types then there is the issue that you are not likely to have access to their deleted edits and that a few of those editors have opted out of being analysed but most importantly the accounts with the highest ever edit counts are not going to fully overlap with the currently most active spielchequers,0

the ctmu is not passing itself off as an academic theory it cant because name is not a member of academia but then again a theory need not be academic to be notable for example print and television journalists and their readers and viewing audiences can deem things notable as well nor do academics have a monopoly on logical or factual correctness scholarly integrity or intellectual merit except possibly in the wellindoctrinated minds of some academics themselves and of course their aspiring apprentices whose eager anticipation of scholastic glory sometimes inflates their academic snobbery to blimpish proportions name complains that we chaps are not the sole arbiters of what belongs in the article this is correct to his credit he invites others to tag his assertions however this is a bit specious for having belatedly come to the realization that he has no relevant verifiable assertions to make he is now specializing in challenging the assertions of others thus we now find him imperiously and rather comically demanding that every one of names assertions receive a separate citation when this is flatly unnecessary because the source material in which those assertions are made is already directly linked to the article it is important for name to understand that he has exactly the same burden of proof as his opponents not only must he provide a legitimate citation for anything he wishes to add to the article but given that the article already links to ample source material anything he wants to remove or qualify must be proven false irrelevant or nonneutral unfortunately he hasnt yet been able to lock onto this signal he still labors under the assumption that like some sort of ultimate bureaucrat he can sit at his keyboard and demand an infinite amount of verification without verifying anything himself by now everyone involved in this matter has come to a stark realization neither name nor any of his tiny but dedicated band of confederates has any citations or other sources of verification for their own accusations they are merely using the article which is faithful to the material it cites to prosecute their philosophical bias against its topic the ctmu which was deemed notable and newsworthy by several international periodicals and news networks they do not like what the ctmu says the article on the ctmu reports on what the ctmu says and what name and the press say about the ctmu hence they do not like the article on the ctmu this conflation of the article with the theory is reflected in names transparent strategy of attacking the theory through the article attempting to dispose of the message by killing the messenger meanwhile he seemingly fails to register the fact that he is himself in glaring violation of wikipedia verifiability policy and that his alltooevident editorial bias is in massive violation of npov as well oozing contempt name has rumbled into the middle of the ctmu article with a load of summary demands snide remarks and selfrighteous factually worthless criticismbut not one relevant citation in hand nothing he says is verifiable as we have now repeatedly seen he cannot even be trusted on matters in which he claims to be an expert this makes it very difficult if not impossible to take his demands seriously,0

the table of sacrifices is an artifact summoned by the three name in order to raise the name and likewise hydrate to the surface typically a being from the reverse maruhage can only individually teleport back and forth between dimensions we see when crimson love and the name return to the dark world they use a teleporter that allows them to raise and fall between the surface my assumption is that an object such as the name needs a lot of energy to rise up to the main world compared to the limited amount of energy that individuals can use thus the table of sacrifices is needed to gather energy from twelve individuals in the form of a clock to power the name after the name summon the clock crimson and love throw over defeated opponents already known to be really strong since they made it to the final stage of the playoff into each number with the assumption that their great energy will siphon from the clock to the name,0

if this was a legal name you might have a valid point its not so you dont why dont you get a ruling as to whether plain english can be used on this name the lede is supposed to encapsulate the rest of the article which is quiet clear that this was a murder not an accidental natural or judicially sanctioned death i do sympathise and understand that for name and the provisional ira the current phase of the conflict is about the definition of the conflict itself for the selfesteem of the socalled republican movement and for the political future of name it is vital that its year campaign of violence be remembered as a just war a regrettable but necessary method of achieving a legitimate aim the vile and sordid deeds that run through that campaign may under pressure be described as wrong they may be accepted as mistakes pira may acknowledge in the curiously passive language it favours that these things should not have happened but they must never ever be called crimes god forbid kiwiexile at dmoz moved here from his talk page at vintagekits request result of pira investigation why exactly do you think that the views of pira should not be fairly represented on namepedia in reference to the presumed death of jeanmcconville i am rather puzzled as to why you keep excising my new section referencing the pira statement on the the abduction and killing of mrs jean mcconville in december dated july by p o neill irish republican publicity bureau dublin is it just because you are still editing carelessly and without respect to other editors work by just hitting the revert button when you see naughty words such as murder and pira however i must congratulate your improvement in tone if not the quality and care you take with your actual edits keep up the improvementkiwiexile at dmoz,0

name and aiden you being nonmuslims assume being allknowing about islam and consider me as an ignorant muslims who misinterprets his religion thanks really for your kind attitude i was talking at an scholarly level quoting verses from quran you can not revert my edits wholesale just because you dont like them and post your own interpretation there i dont like to get into a revert war though i am pretty sure that my edits are quite justified and i will be the one who will eventually win the debate you can always add the pov tag to the section and try to find the opinion of other scholars or quote other quranic verses regarding your point doing original research i would like to say that it is just an excuse and maybe a good strategy to quite the beginners if we really dont want to do any original research many parts of many articles in wikipedia should be deleted all the articles will become mere quotes from several scholars without any glue to keep different quotes together you statement that i am doing original research is by itself an original research it is strange to me that somebody claims that hisher understanding of islam is authentic and the others are just original researchs,0

regarding loyalmoonie and lgbt categories looked into it and this editor seems to be pushing an antilgbt agenda theyve done similar stuff over at sailor name and made officiallooking warnings to other editors this quote is bizarre and is quite telling to insert those categories would ultimately give other people who may not even support the lgbt movement reading the article the assumption that every person who does enjoy sailor name is a homosexual andor supports ssm i dont personally watchread sailor name or know much about it so im not confident enough to readd the categories but the reasoning for their removal is flawed regardless and there is a sourced part in the article about female homosexualitytalk,0

its not really for us to decide what is a conspiracy theory but indeed the article rather confusingly mixes conspiracy claims and factual information about jewish leaders in the bolshevik movement there was a recent newspiece a quote by name times of israel name first soviet government was mostly jewish apparently some people feel such quote is conspiracist whereas others say its just a statement of a statistical fact in any case the option is the article shouldnt imply any notion of jewish participation in the early communist movement is a conspiracy theory however im not sure if that general topic jews in the bolshevik movement should be covered in detail in this article,0

well done wikipedia from name in arbroath scotland dear wikipedia i am glad that you have included a section for opposition forums to the gmc to appear on your website i had earlier thought of stopping my donations to wikipedia over your failure to acknowledge the abolish the gmc group but will now continue to support your cause because i am now satisfied that your inclusion of them now shows you to be fair my neigbour lost her only child because of the incompetence of one of the current bosses of the general medical council but the gmc covered up the case so we couldnt get justice so please permanently protect the gmc opposition page from further attack by unscrupulous gmc agents as i have just had to repaste it in honour of the poor wee child who was murdered by the wicked gmc boss please do this in memory of him thank you my name is name from arbroath scotland,0

name i have listed this article at wpdrv for possible undeletion based on information i have received regarding a book that has been written by trehin about his fictional city urville interested parties should contribute to the discussion is this still deserving of featured article status im beginning to think that this article should be removed from the list of featured articles it seems to me that political ideas and attempts to be politically correct have compromised the factual veracity of this article this should be a pretty straightforward article about a neurological disorder like epilepsy or name instead it reads as if name syndrome is either some kind of blessing or lifestyle choice and that there are negligible drawbacks to having it the very fact that many of the participants on the talk page take issue or offense at even calling as a disorder or disease when it is viewed as such by the medical community is rather telling i really think the mainstream medical and scientific view should be emphasized as medicine and science strive to have the neutral point of view that this article lacks im not looking for an argument im simply warning those interested that if this article stays as it is i will probably lobby to have it removed as a featured article,0

you cant ban anyone so please avoid talking about bans since there isnt any consensus you are just trying to impose your will regardless of the facts other people are providing to back their statements without backing your statements yourself this map made by name is more than enough it clearly shows that for instance in veneto of blond people is from three to seven times higher than in calabria and in name is at least three times higher than in sardinia this is definitely relevant now of course you will say this map is old but you wont provide a newer one not credible but you wont provide a more credible map same difference as other countries but you wont provide a single source proving that etc try to stick at this map what is wrong about it as long as people wont provide sources to back their statements i will consistently restore any reference in the article,0

opinions of rightwing economist editors notwithstanding it is by no means disruptive to point out the achingly obvious fact that the official name of this prize is currently the sveriges riksbank prize in economic sciences in memory of alfred nobel and that it is not a nobel prize and that colloquial names for the prize are not what should dictate the terms used by encyclopedias it should certainly be mentioned that nobel prize in economics is one of several commonly used shorthand terms for the prize but that fact does not alter those other facts,0

the problem is that people keep trying to state that bsas policies are this and that there is no policy that says homosexual scouts cannot be members to state otherwise is a lie and or just be it is a contraversy page doesnt allow you state lies or add or you can list things as misinterpretations of the rules and things like that but it you try to say scouting does this or scouting does that then you need to be sure scouting actually says that even the misinterpretations of the rules need sources just because an editor might misinterprete the rules doesnt mean anyone in mainstream has can you find a source for somewhere where a homosexual youth was removed from the program just for being a openly homosexual youth then insert it unless you have it or an actual policy from bsa that says you cant be an openly homosexual youth member then what is being added is or,0

i keep wondering why you coming here arguing with me when you make no sense at all dont you realize that many people might be coming to see this discussion here you are basically telling everyone here not to trust the cia bbc united nations chart that is posted above which is also posted at bbc and that everyone should trust your map which was made by an unknown person first of all i am not arguing over the number of each ethnic group but instead you are i never changed the numbers rather i changed and replaced the old hard to read and understand map of yours my map the one above explains little more about each ethnic group while yours does not demographics of afghanistan should not just be the numbers of each group but also include a brief explanation about who or what these people are and or where they originate from by watching your actions and you keep insisting that your map remains in afghanistans article there must be something you are up to also something i noticed you keep talking about the numbers of pashtuns should be lower which indicates that you wish to see them die or something i will slowly look around for an administrator to help with removing and deleting your silly outdated man soon i wish not to bother talking or discussing anything with you as i find that you are not a nice person to talk or socialize with you keep reminding that pashtuns killed this pashtuns killed that why dont you discuss about pashtuns always being killed by invaders they have the right to rule their country and they have the right to kill anyone they find as a traitor to their country this law is practiced in all the countries of the world by now ive already realized that you are not just a traitor to afghanistan but also a true enemy of pashtuns i have allah almighty god on my side and thats why i always win,0
the movement is obviously not an organisation but encompasses various organisations some of them at loggerheads with each other however in presentday official contexts the moniker osho is used as a matter of course this applies to recent trademark disputes to case law and to us human rights reporting as per examples above for examples of recent scholarly studies using the osho moniker see we have to agree to disagree i think we should use the modern term that has supplanted the old one as a compromise i have previously indicated that osho rajneesh movement or oshorajneesh movement see here for example would suit me as well,0

kurdistan kurdistan is not a geopolitical region theres a region called kurdistan in iraq theres a region called kurdistan in iran theres no region called kurdistan in turkey thats akin to placing an algeristan in france and making an article that treats it like a country there are some country articles on wiki that list less facts than a supposed region kurds are a minority in turkey just like the hispanics in usa or algerians in france as ludicrous as it would seem to place a mexicistan or algeristan on those countries where those minorities are heavily populated in it is to list a kurdistan that includes turkish territory as long as we dont declare san diego mexicistan which mexico actually did own at one point and not just have a rippedup treaty claiming it it is equally ridiculous to list kurdistan in turkey in iraq a country that was set up by the british merging territories a region called kurdistan warrants an article as the kurds were just placed together with other ethnicities by a colonizing force but i call bs on turkey being listed under kurdistan as turkey does not have a region named kurdistan and kurds are turkish citizens not living under a kurdish state like in iraq whom prints their own passports and such,0

the name group in response i never provided where he went to school i added he is a jd rather than delete he is a jd juris doctor then refer to him as dr name a jd is a doctor of jurisprudence same as a phd why do you allow personal information thats good for you but not for others who might be interested in knowing more he was important enough to post an article so why do you think any reader will be satisfied with a sum total of data saying he owns a rental property in agoura hills with a meaningless political contribution the property posted is a rental where he no longer lives and maybe never did how is that useful in an article about organized labour you said it yourself the article should be about the company but in actual fact he is the company hes a flight instructor whom i know from our fbo flight base operation lots of people know him he hasnt contributed to republicans for years look at the site you provided last one was why continue to keep outdated useless information the article cited by dr name a very learned fellow contains some useful info but also contains factually incorrect information even he can make mistakes i am a lawyer and logan is a british economist and may understand eu law but does not understand us labor law just because he writes about it does not mean he understands it there is no newspaper article about cdn that says employees were awarded from the court of appeals he wrote incorrectly the citation provided which corrects his article is from the court dockets which is a better citation i provided the citation from the law firm that won the civil case against cdn i removed nothing about the case itself only corrected the information in such a way that the non legal lay person could understand the fundamental differences between nlrb law and dol law and civil actions filed with the district courts what name wrote that you cite is liking saying someone was cited by the faa but tried at the name are you british faa is federal aviation admin and name is dept of motor vehicles they are not related anymore than nlrb is to district court or civil cases name works in nlrb jurisdiction and the case you cite is a civil action in district courts not related if you want cdn discussed first part is fine but the civil action is not there should be another topic developed in wikipedia for cdn logans article used as a citation lacks any credible legal citation connecting name to the civil case only a legal citation should be used there are none available djb is a very well known person and lots of lawyers both company and union know him no matter which side of the aislethis information is flawed if you are going to discuss legal issues then get them right am i being picky yes inside the law you cant just throw something at the ceiling and hope it sticks deleting facts for fiction is beneath the dignity of what wikipedia has strived to promote why do you say the article contains everything anyone needs to know to justify deleting contributions how is that possible when wikipedia is an opened forum for knowledgeable people to build and add more you think the sum total for the reader should be that name owns a rental property in agoura hills how is that related to the name group please stop the generalities and provide facts i contributed and tell me exactly how the citation or tone can be improved and let me do that also please define what is meant by tone by the wayare you a wikipedia staff editor or administrator thank you arabianrider,0

speedy deletion of myaviationnet a tag has been placed on myaviationnet requesting that it be speedily deleted from wikipedia this has been done under section g11 of the criteria for speedy deletion because the article seems to be blatant advertising which only promotes a company product group service or person and would need to be fundamentally rewritten in order to become an encyclopedia article please read our the guidelines on spam as well as the wikipediabusiness faq for more information if you think that this notice was placed here in error you may contest the deletion by adding to the top of the page just below the existing speedy deletion or db tag coupled with adding a note on the talk page explaining your position but be aware that once tagged for speedy deletion if the article meets the criterion it may be deleted without delay please do not remove the speedy deletion tag yourself but dont hesitate to add information to the article that would would render it more in conformance with wikipedias policies and guidelines,0

i also did a bit of work on putting the references in the somewhat odd format that wikipedia uses one good rule to use is to include all the information you can title date author so that another editor can verify the information in the source the article caught my eye because we once lived nearby the description paragraph still seems like almost verbatim from the form and we are supposed to paraphrase into these articles i am running out of time this afternoon but it should give you an idea if you havetime to work on it some more the paul shoup article itself needs similar work thanks,0

thank you for your suggestion please explain to me how after checking the last few thousands of both of your edits and the first five hundred of each too and finding that all of your edits are of the same manner even though the articles vary wildly and are unrelated therefore that i should not believe you are a single purpose account i did not read through every single edit but i read through five pages of five hundred and only of the namespace article and did not see a significant number i think you had two in and my guess is that it is representative since you started and ended in the same manner of edits outside of that purpose which is cleanup the tags stay since you are a single purpose account simple isnt it,0

good information going for the most accurate and complete encyclopedic content possible should we then create a different article for the gong baotian and xie pieqi styles rather than dilute the style information of each style my thought is that we should have a separate article for each subsystem that varies significantly from the norm perhaps one called xie pieqi line yin style baguazhang and another gong baotian line yin style baguazhang for each style with significant amounts of content as well as verifiable sources splits from the main article seem to make sense to me,0

no we dont the name ivory coast contains only englishalphabet letters and it would sort just fine in almost all cases where c te divoire remains missorted often appearing after croatia after cyprus after czech republic you can see this by looking at categorycommunications by country and seeing where the subcategory categorycommunications in c te divoire is missorted even though the sorting of the article of the same name has been fixed can you see the difference in order or you can see it by looking at categorynations at the summer olympics and seeing where the article c te divoire at the summer olympics is missorted there are hundreds of those problems out there why dont you make yourself useful and go fix some of them,0

i know it is true so was the information about the uk and indonesia but you still didnt think they should be there please explain why to make special mention of a country when they have done nothing to deserve it is to show a partisan point of veiw to delete other countries who are in the same place is especially biased please accept that although what you have done may not be because of your point of veiw it can be seen as others as being point of view and therfore it has no place on wikipedia and leave the tag so that other people can see that there is a debate on the section if you can find a better tag then put it there just make sure there is some kind of pointer to the debate,0

i would like to know what you think of the new planetary system feel free to write whatever you like i think it is an absoloute complete waste of time and money the scientists are just trying to get extra credit for discovering new planets when theyre only claiming asteroids that theyve known about for years are planets its an outrage for instance theyve known about ceres for over years as an asteroid funny how it suddenly became a planet,0
mentioning name gave up natural selection and became a nameian the article currently makes no mention of the historically important fact that name himself converted from the natural selection theory of evolution to a nameian environmentalist position in later editions of the origin of species which went into different editions by hence i propose the following insert at the first name quotation in the current section publication of the theory of natural selection which i also propose should be retitled publication of the name s theory of evolution proposed insert however even in the first edition of his book name only claimed natural selection was the main means of selection but not the only one in the last sentence of its introduction he said furthermore i am convinced that natural selection has been the main but not exclusive means of modification but by he had published six editions of the book with corrections and revisions and in later editions in response to criticism of his theory of inheritance name even gave up the theory of natural selection as the main selector of evolution with its strong principle of inheritance in favour of nameian environmentalism with a changing environment as the main selector as cd darlington wrote in in his foreword to a new and first reprint of the otherwise unavailable first edition of the origin let no one imagine however that in the world of science names theory has enjoyed an unchequered prosperity on the contrary the dust of battle is only now beginning to settle on the hotly disputed groundthe most abiding source of trouble was that discovered by the professor of engineering at edinburgh professor flemingsic name pointed out in that any new variation appearing in one individual would be lost or swamped in later generations when that individual was compelled to cross with others of the old and established type and its differences as name believed blended in inheritance nature would never be able to keep any differences to select names defence against this objection was already prepared he had hinted it in the first edition of the origin of species at the end of the introduction he had said that natural selection has been the main but not exclusive means of modification in later editions he hedged further he fell back on the other means these depended chiefly on the action of a changing environment its direct effect in altering living things so as to suit it must be inherited in adopting this view name was giving up his own and names peculiar claim to originality he was giving up the argument implied in the title of the book and he was falling back on the discarded and disreputable theory of name p xvii on the origin of species by means of natural selection first edition reprint in the thinkers name by watts co but darlington failed to establish names theory was discarded or disreputable in fact the theory of natural selection only became accepted in the mid20th century with the mendeliannameian synthesis in population genetics but even by nameism was still not accepted in academia according to darlington in view of the triumph of his ideas it might be thought that nameism in all civilised countries would be taught as one of the foundations of thought that in the universities everywhere it would be critically expounded and experimentally developed that is true of its remote and general applications to such sciences as astronomy and geology but where as in its applications to ourselves in the study of the genetics of men and to the histories of nations as exact knowledge of the principles of variation hybridization and selection is required we hear on every side nothing but confused and ignorant speculations at the same time the foundation of nameism in the experimental study of evolution has largely been smothered in names own country the universities with their museums and botanic gardens are happy to forget what in they were unable to resist they contain no memorial of his work and all the means of developing his doctrine they frustrate by an arrangement of teaching which the theory of evolution is not allowed to disturb the old pedantic learning of botany and zoology which name treated as one subject they continue to cleave asunder burying the halves under their ancient schedules of instruction ibid pxviiixix i also propose the following edit of the articles introduction his book on the origin of species posited natural selection was the main selector in the evolution and origin of species but by its sixth edition name had abandon,0

the consensus agreed on earlier was that the ntsb briefings are an authoritative source and rightly so they do not need to be separately quoted by 3rd party mediapress refs let alone by questionable blog postings or other online media and yeah id expect people to actually have seen all ntsb briefings otherwise they have really no reason whatsoever to bother reviewing stuff here if anybody cant be bothered to watch the ntsb briefings then please just read the transcripts frankly it is beyond me how you guys are tolerating this type of workflow and behavior even perceiving me stating that as an attack how can it be an attack to expect people to be familiar with the topic theyre contributing to honestly all this goes to show the weaknesses and shortcomings of crowdsourced encyclopediawriting theres no proper hierarchy and if theres one its one where seniority and stylistic aptitude count more than a factual background yeah this is kinda disappointing,0

thank you for the discussion i may have worded it wrong even though officially latin is not used in the citystate in the same way as the holy see leaving only the italian translation can also mislead readers to believe italian english etc are only used there even in documents and the average reader will still tend to confuse the two entities of the vatican city state and holy see together even after reading the article even i do i believe the note therefore kills two birds with one stone with the clarification in a concise manner and instead of removing it any help in clarity would be appreciated and help the article overall,0

to name you stated no one is entitled to remove or edit others comments yet that has been repeatedly done to my comments you are applying a double standard either no one is allowed to edit or everyone is allowed to edit as per wikipedia the free encyclopedia prejudice to which editors are allowed to edit and which ones are not is a violation of free speech in the united states and a contradiction to a free encyclopedia name is not a feeling or a theory either it is superdeterministic or it is not hence absolute philosophy has nothing to do with the laws that govern our existence please feel free to conduct the thought experiment to prove name wrong and the crankery bunch opinions are valid if you understood what the meaning of absolute meant you would have also understood that opinions in contradiction to names laws will always be invalid,0
okay i think ive read everything relevant no i do not think you were too harsh some of his edits have been a bit uncontructive and the aneditor deception was exactly what it looked like deception if you are worried you can always play it safe in the future by being deliberately less harsh and then seeing what the response is that keeps the options open just like vandal warning levels do it gives the recipient a chance to see where things are headed and the onus is on them to correct if they dont you will have been patient and have given due warnings further being more harsh than appropriate means youve done something wrong and you cannot easily go backward from that however if you are under harsh you can always go the next step if needed while we are on the topic of this editor could you do a copyvio check for me i cant access the fr site name,0

the previous comment makes several incorrect statements about names status as a script the origin of its name and what sanskrit refers to name is a single script like latin arabic or devanagari in all their variations are single scripts it is most definitely not a group or family of scripts no separate sulat bisaya ever existed and authentic kapampangan script was merely the most notable regional variant of name there were no special regional variations despite the false impression given by inaccurately wirtten samples of name from various regions as written by foreigners not used to writing the letters correctly scott name and especially name have shown clearly that the handwriting of different people in the same region even from the same document shows moer differences than the socalled regional scripts written in distorted handwriting by foreigners modern kulitan or s lat kapampangan is the recent invention of one person who took a 19th century french visitors interpretation of name letters as written in an unknown source or sources from pampanga and combined these with a structure derived from a combination of name and korean hangul it is a modern constructed script with no relation to how it was actually written when it was used as part of daily life the name name originated with tagalog speakers not the spanish who at first just called it sus letras their letters name comes from a word that originally meant to put things in a sequence or a particular order sanskrit is a language not a script or group of scripts all these facts can be checked in the existing literature anyone who wants to write an accurate article should consult at the very least name web site ang name names el name en el archivo de santo name names the old philippine writingla antigua escritura filipina and marcilla y mart ns estudio de los antiguos alfabetos filipinos,0

name sexpositive feminist here are the supporting links you asked for you stupid twit if you are too lazy and full of yourself to read them in their entirety then i will just post the relevant sections here name on the other hand i ve been saying in public for five years ago as someone who s endorsed prostitutes and strippers and that whole extreme of sexpositive experience that i m concerned about the effect on young people people growing up from in a climate where it s gone to the opposite direction i m already out there concerned about this so i m really outraged to be stereotyped in that way by her because i am a career teacher and yes when you have a situation where commercialised sex is being pushed without a true eroticism i ve been saying this for years that we have got to a point of meaningless exhibitionism without real eroticism i m for eroticism name is a major american social critic names academic writing focuses on the role of vibrant dangerous sexuality in human history names key importance to sexpositive feminism is not only her writings on sex but her advocacy of traditional values like canon texts name is somewhat of an intellectual enigma a conservative and academic feminist who revels in low and high culture alike and celebrates sexualities disapproved of by mainstream western culture name has in many ways presented a respectable face for prosex feminism to the world at large,1

edit conflict i am very exasperated by the rant above i have really tried to respond to all of your points name but i dont think you will be satisfied by any reply other than complete agreement i am sorry if i accused you of anything you have not done i apologize lets go back to your sentence about the accuracy of memris translations i asked you to reproduce your refs on the talk page for the sake of clarity of discussion but instead of helping me out by doing that you spend screen after screen berating me for not answering you ok here they are a b mayor of london press release a b c d name tape threatens us states memriorg november a b name did osama send election threat philadelphia daily news november name email debate ok lets discuss these refs name press release is unacceptable as a rs on this name does not have any translation expertise in arabic he is therefore not an acceptable cite on the accuracy of translation you are using names own translation to say that memris translations are inaccurate that is quite bizarre namei dont know what more i can sy about this she is talking about the binladen tape i believe the only person she quote with any translation expertise is cole aljazeera the most prominent arabic news source iin the world translated the same way memri did name disputed the translation after the fact saying that binladen was not using standard arabic and also disputed their interpretation no one in the world excpet for binladen knows what he meant to say in that tape this is not enough of an example to generalize from could you consider reproducing the part of the name piece that refers to the accuracy of translation here for discussion i have read those articles a fewtimes and believe that name came up with one minor example i also note that you keep inserting a cole quote and his blog is not an acceptable source for this article finally you want to use headings selectivity and bias and then place quotes under one or the other that contain sentences which contain both types of crits i split up some of the quotes so that the ideas of the critics would come under the appropriate headings you object to this and say your version is more well written i disagree im not sure what more to say about this elizmr it does not help our conversation for you to refer to my statement to you as a rant and it does not help our conversation for you to falsely accuse me of doing things i have not done as you apologized for above nor to falsely accuse me of not doing things that i have done as you just did above i did provide references to my citations above in this talk page more than a week ago but you never responded see here i even made the links easy to use simply click on them in the text i added elizmr lets discuss them in the order you cited the first is a mayor of london press release published by the greater london authority city hall and available on the londongovuk website do you claim that this is not a rs your objection that the mayor of london namee is not personally a certified translator is absurd this press release is available from the city hall in arabic and other languages so clearly he did not prepare this document personally but with the help of a staff that spoke arabic would you try to deny a statement by name about iran in a wp article because he is not personally trained to translate persian your argument is just plain silly i am using names statement to prove to you that the cole dispute was about translation since you were questioning that above memris president makes this statement the us media in general mistranslated the words so clearly he considered this dispute to be about translation name published her article about the cole dispute in the philadelphia inquirer do you claim that this newspaper is not a rs in her article she writes that supposed warning to red states was lost in muddled american translations released with the video last week the middle east media research institute claimed but translation problems or no experts at a variety of prominent think tanks disagreed with the idea that name was preparing to sort out safe states from target states do you see why this is clearly a dispute about memri translation in a rs name and name debated in a special report in the guardian u,0

furthermore although i am a political opponent of name on many levels it is not i who believes that calling him a faggot will hurt his cause on a political level you just refuse to acknowledge that he was called this during the reign of his son to according to the accepted standards of the time period thought it would be scandalous and outright damaging to his rule because of their convention the slurs did help portray his rule as the beginning of the end for those who were out to get him now you repeat homophobic insults and intertwine your own homosexuality with his identity although he was a straight man stuck in a quicksand of backbiting that included homophobic language why perpetuate falsehoods other than to make yourself feel better that somebody famous is alleged to be gay like you especially if you like to smear him as a hypocrite for all the abuse you suffered by fundie bible thumpers it is obvious where you stand or bend over in this,1

whenever you see brackets that means that the editor has added an explanation in this case organic remains was added to explain the word they while wm used the word fossil in the previous sentence it is clear that they were referring to organic remains because by definition recently buried remains such as what is now occurring are not fossils from the dictionary of geologic terms 3rd edition by name and name fossil any remains trace or imprint of a plant or animal that has been preserved in the earths crust since some past geologic or prehistoric time nothing buried in the present can be a fossil for it is in historic time and further you do not quickly bury fossils to preserve them you quickly bury organic remains to protected them long enough so they they can eventually become fossils in some future geologic era wm likely used the term fossil loosely like many editors of this wp page to refer to organic remains that might become fossils per definition in some geologic era in the future it is unfortunate that wm were not as precise as they might have been because uninformed people such as talkorigins misunderstand and twist what they said as much impact as wm have had on creationary thought nearly all fellow creationist today recognize that the genesis flood is now way out of date modern creationary geologists have moved well beyond the genesis flood when critics quote it it displays their complete lack of competency on modern creationism,0

so far nobodys reverted me so that gives me hope meantime let me pick your brain on a broader related issue in recent years wikipedia has likely gained in importance as a vetting tool for employers clients and others considering doing business with someone naturally the one doing the vetting has the lions share of responsibility in judging an entrys reliability and supplementing it with other research that said do we bear some degree of ethical obligation to researchers to ensure an entry presents as far as possible an accurate wellrounded picture of the subject in the case of ms name i was concerned that universities or other organizations looking to employ her andor give her some sort of public platform would come away with the impression that nothing about her merits further scrutiny what are your thoughts,0
the use of the word goal was merely an approximation i hoped would help the explanation its not currently used in the article to explain this a different way if you construct a scale with anything but a geometric sequence eg an arithmetic sequence the steps would not be perceived to be the same if the perception of intervals was arithmetic instead of geometric our equal tempered scales would be arithmetic sequences instead,0

considering this article is about a canadian train used only in canada i dont see the point in using both unit systems more so when the conversion between them does not work ie the mileage per gallon versus the litres per km moreover canada is using the metric system since the s therefore the engineering specifications are probably in metric units as required by law anyways thats my two cents on the issue,0

mmm the closest i can think on the spot of is the name commentary they talk about names loyalty to his mother and how when he figures out that names using him all bets are off becasue you dont mess with names mama theres probably something else name definitely has the most character depth for name i dont have the f13 dvds im afraid so i cant use them as references having looked at your sandbox though all the moral crusader stuff has also been said of name my personal favourite of the big three would it be or to draw a brief comparison between the two provided you didnt explicitly say that name was influenced by name,0

paranoia and parasitic infections question the validity of this statement other common paranoid delusions include the belief that the person has an imaginary disease or parasitic infection delusional parasitosis that the person is on a special quest or has been chosen by god that the person has had thoughts inserted or removed from conscious thought or that the persons actions are being controlled by an external force my research suggests that infections including parasitic ones can result in symptoms of paranoia the bodies reaction to a real threat of attack on the micro level look up organic infections of paranoia then there is the case of prescription drugs that cause this symptom name side effects,0

good policy suggestion on class assignments my sympathies about your encountering a class assignment that has gone badly awry i think your looks like a good idea and i support it its especially regrettable that we are not receiving more well sourced thoughtful edits to psychology articles here as most of those articles badly need better sourcing and more coherent editing to represent current established knowledge from a neutral point of view keep up the good work talk an appology is in order dear colin i am not sure if you will have the chance to read this or if youll have a moment to respond but i am a student in the university of toronto and specifically one of the psychology students mentioned in the article however before i go any further may i express my most sincere and deepest appologies to you and everyone involved i will not try to make excuses for my actions nor will i try to do so for my fellow students as i do not speek for them i realise and no doubt others will too that what we left behind was unbecoming of a sutdent at u of t and most importantly i realise that we did as future scholars was wrong i know that you and you colleagues are considering taking extreme measures to ensure the content of wikipedia stays secure as a responce to our actions though i can understand where you are coming from i do not believe that this will solve any of your problems and will only make things worse in the longrun i see this situation as a systemic error on both of our sides but as a first year student i have very little educational and social clout to enforce my statement i am asking as both an avid reader of wikipedia and as a lover of knowledge please do not blackout our privaleges to use and edit articles let us both use this experience as a steping stone to learn how to go about doing this in a constructive manner benefits wikipedia and my school looking to make this a better place civcodex thanks we have no issues with people who are interested in wikipedia coming to edit wikipedia what seems to be the issue is when we have a large group of students editing wikipedia not for the love of knowledge but simply for marks these students do not stay around and seem to plagiarize at a high rate talk contribs email if i write on your page reply on mine have replied on your talk page talk proposed new policy id like to advertise this very draft proposed new policy comments please talk i think the central dillema is this a student could make a poorquality contribution that harms wikipedia but then recieve partial or full credit if the grading rubric was accurate a student would receive or negative credit my personal solution has been to engage with professors to try and influence the assignment increase their wikipedia knowedge and improve the grading rubrics themselves im fairly proud of education programsaint louis universitysignal transduction sp13 which i helped write you might want to ask there should also be some sort of policy re how the community reacts to profs and students the active community is more likely to be aware of and act on policies in the first place and we are often more unkind than necessary in the second i proposed an alternative idea on the assignments talk page as an example of the sort of implementation that i would hope is compatible with any policy we adopt barnstars styleborder 1px solid gray backgroundcolor name rowspan valignmiddle rowspan stylefontsize xlarge padding verticalalign middle height 1em the barnstar,0
relaunch this was to judge by appearances as theoretical physicist name puts it it took two decades of it to reveal what the cantab editors were really up to but it s now clear that their achievement was staggering basically if each letter of a cantab article is plotted as a point in an ndimensional space then you find that the piece on the piece on name written in early actually traces out an encrypted set of instructions for twisting vortical gravity fields to produce a singularity in space and the city issue of summer is decades if not centuries ahead of its time the uninitiated were evidently deceived into seeing nothing more than a shameless piece of careerist selfaggrandizement in the hallowed cantab tradition in fact says name this is no less than a prototype of a dimensional machine which timelocks a dimensional black hole we can see the equations but just don t have enough neurons to even begin to figure out what they really mean but where was the portal and why did it have to be closed was it in the pasteup room cupboard had interdimensional creatures from another universe been progressively using it to control the minds of the film reviewers in is it true that at am on may a packet of chocolate name on the layout desk suddenly shot across the room and disappeared into the wall why did so many people go into the nearby round church and so few come out and why did so few people go into the nearby indian restaurant and so many come out who or what was the chief editor who subsequently disappeared in south america did he come from an extraterrestrial civilisation so advanced that trade journalism is unknown there and why does supernatural sleuth name repeatedly censor any attempt to tell what really went on so long ago years after he d left cambridge what is his dark secret had he already experienced something that has tormented him ever since and prevents him from getting a life even today this is evidently one mystery too many even for him unsigned but by user endoscope5,0

actually to clarifyafter name was forced to vacate the world titleand retire due to a concussion the planned hart vs name title match was changed less than hours before the match to name since there was no time to build up the match it was decided to do a screwjob finish and then build to the rematch at superbrawl the next month so name won the matchwith sids leg clearly on the ropes and then the next night on name the decision was overturned the official result of the sould out main event was name and name fought to a nocontest end of story except not pissed off at the shitty booking name confronted booker name namewho name had a personal history with re name name then told name if he didnt like the booking he could ask for his contract release no questions asked name took him up on it and jumped to the wwf the difference between this and the millions of other screwjobdusty finishes was that rather than the belt seemingly moving from one champion to the next then being handed backthe bgelt was vacant before name won the title thus the overturning of the decision made the belt vacant once more sid also had a seeming title victory only for the result to be overturned due to his pinning the wrong name officially at the time the belt went from hart to a vacant state to name nash awarding the belt to himself okay so name has bought at wcw and recognised both names and sids first wins as world title wins he has also recognised name two awa dusty finishes as official world title wins i dont like it but i guess its official now the obvious question is since name owns wwe wcw ecw and awa can he say overturn name wcw world title win at this point thats just stupid the sandman the sandman won the ecw championship five times not one as the article shows wwa world title where did it go,0

wpfilm coordinator hey i saw your message concerning the upcoming elections for wpfilm concerning the project coordinators and that you might be adding more im a bit confused concerning the scope of their responsibilities is it largely updating reviewing articles and aiding in the establishment of task forces at least as far as i can see do coordinators generally specialize in various areas ie one handles task forces others reviewing or a combination of any such duties if so i was wondering whether i could specialize as a coordinator for featured lists i rank second in terms of total featured lists made among all wikipedians and i have a very good grasp of what is required for fl status if i was elected i probably would work towards encouraging featured lists under wpfilms scope and there certainly are a host of lists that could be pushed up to fl status with a coordinated effort that said i understand that im relatively new to the film project and that there might be more suitable candidates who are more familiar with the project just curious as to your thoughts on the matter cheers converse,0

no apologies i make no apologies for what i said on the humanities reference desk at times i may have gone too far elsewhere in wikipedia but not in this instance when people say stupid things on the reference desk i have no qualms about pointing this out and am not likely to change any time in the future especially when it is unlikely the person who asked the question is being sincere note that assume good faith doesnt really apply in the reference desk else we wouldnt be able to suggest that users are asking homework questions which we do all the time or otherwise just wasting our time which we do as well i rarely frequent the humanities reference desk mostly science only so perhaps you dont get as many cranks at humanities but really i dont care stupid questions deserve pointed replies anyway ive said my piece and dont want to debate this anymore as such im likely to ignore any further follow ups by you if you feel my comments so bad that you wish to seek outside assitance thats up to you,0
as i said theres nothing wrong with comparing an editor with a demonstrably antisemitic bias and a demonstrably proconspiracy theory bias to the nazis sure name would probably disapprove but i think even hed admit thats theres nothing fallacious about such a comparison yes its uncivil but we dont block for incivility any mroe and you cant expect someone whos been trolled and attacked first and somewhat tired both physically and figuratively to be all rainbows and sunshine wppoke applies here you know its bad form to watch someone get continually more annoyed by an editors actions until they snap and then you pounce and block them,0

march utc see you jackasses are soooo flippant when you speak of biblical things yet you wonder why people like me get angry you have just proved one thing you dont care wikipedia doesnt care and this liberal rag will do whatever it wants so screw us little peeons who arent as high and mighty as you wikigods you make me sick you really make me sick you are the perfect atheist liberal so be proud i knew even speaking to you would be a waste of time that is why i nor any of the places i work will ever allow students to use wikipedia we give an instant f to anyone that puts it in their endnotes,1

calculus hello youve made a number of changes that ive reverted because they look more like an attempt to push a point of view than adding new information to the encyclopaedia you will probably need to discuss and find consensus for your changes if you want to keep them,0
im not talking about belief of majority in fact i would presume a billion muslims specifically state he did not claim to be god and many of other faiths would agree im saying i dont think we have any facts to solidly state by encyclopedia standards whether name claimed to be a god or not you can object because its unclear but your statement he did not claim he was god is merely your opinion you really cant prove it considering the historical effect in least the concept he claimed to be god i think may make it relevant here but i could see taking it off as disputed although if you want to get into it in many books ive read indicate name did not claim to be god either he believed that name was the son of god but not god he had an arian view of name and of his own role as son of god although i added her it sounds possible that this mita woman only believed she contained the holy spirit rather then was the holy spirit yet you dont object on those or ones that may even be more debatable in least in the case of name the idea he claimed to be god is the mainstream belief of his followers and the existent writing on him,0
you have just risen in my estimation,0
i am gratified that you have truthfully explained your assumptions of bad faith i dislike dishonesty more than most i endeavor to keep the big boys honest which includes you since you immigrated over here so do not continue our disputes here i could call you out for abusive blocks on the little boys place that are do not occur here but im not a petty person drop the conspiracy theory and move away from the dead horsemost of the dead were congolese isnt a real sentence seriously,0

something anonymous editing has given rise to vandalism manifesto pass to all nameans vandalism is good vandalism does not come from a sheer desire to cause harm vandals do their thing all over name from frustration and hatred because incompetent editors who have no skills no degrees no expertise usually no names have done multiple reverts and edits of the work of others vandalism is a good and natural response to nolifers as in get a life who do edits edits a year and who have actual name of or more and are proud of it these jerks deserve have their own pages vandalized over and over as long as they are in effect vandalizing the pages of others in the name of being a cop vandals keep nolife editors admins bureaucrats and stewards honest or at least busy reverting the reverts they get on their own pages vandalism is good it helps drive these nutcases into the ground with nervous breakdowns the culture of namepedia is veryvery sick and vandals are needed to cull the herd support your local vandal vandal god,1

hey there buddy i am back a quote from name the sad thing is that our fellow here freedom skies appears to have been raised in america or britain and yet he seems more indian than american or british and along with that supports a radical view of the world that is peppered religious ideas and along with that he is educated it is truly sad if india industrializes and this hindutva movement holds sway the world will see a flourishing of a very powerful and scary radicalized country firstly can you tell me what being american or british is america and britain are both made of of various immigrant and former immigrant communities from italy ireland china guatemala and so forth so if name is being proud of his culture is that evil secondly you have an over negative estimation of countries outside of your clouded world suggestion join the marine corps that is one thing i have learned is understanding the world through travel thirdly i am utterly shocked at your comment on freedom skies being educated as being a sad thing if not a scary thing does that threaten you that indians are educated please answer yes or no no need to give a disertation or oration thank you also that statement reminds me of when the slaveowners back in the southern part of america during the civil war used to consider blacks getting education as a threat to their lifestyle as a matter of fact it was illegal for an afroamerican to go to school or even learn to read since it was viewed as a threat to the racist slave owners i will even go a further step to say that back then these racists from the colonial south felt threatened that the slaves would become a very powerful and scary radicalized community regarding your previous posts here is some food for thought in the marine corps as name or someone in command if you are at a bar or a party you never show that you are drunk if you are drunk you do not admit it youre basically shooting yourself in the foot by admitting that you have had a few drinks while fiddling around on wikipedia and in some cases cases learn from that pal,0

responses i was not referring to this only your posts on name recently i was not referring to these events dating back to it does not appear relevant to your actions now i am sure people can refer to the arbcom case for the facts if they wish i did review the situation with a sitting arbcom member before starting rfa as you are aware this is the first time i have heard about it it seems a bit late to be digging this up now i know nothing about this your page was not even on my watchlist until today no i was not even aware of revenge nominations if i ever commented in a dr related to this it was not as part of any pattern and i do not recall ever doing so i do not watch everything you do on commons nor did i watch everything name did i am not name nor do i take responsibility for his actions if you wish to have my help on commons please leave me a note there i briefly looked at s contributions to assess if he was active as an otrs volunteer on commons the copyright violations seemed blatant to my eyes shocking for an otrs volunteer granting verification tickets to images this was selfevident even looking at the first thumbnails some of which had been marked as copyright problems previously commons is short of experienced copyright reviewers when we spot problems we ought to mark it for review it is not like i was deleting them on sight i am leaving the review to others if you wish to discuss ktr101s uploads to commons i suggest that happens on commons your responses appear to avoid the central issue which is how you are now using name to hound me you appear to be making statements based on a time when you had privileged trusted rights and using this history to paint the worst picture of me possible if you have allegations to make please make them directly to me as you have above and at least then i can ask you to link to the sources for any assertions you make and respond to those facts again you are digging through history some of which is years old and the most recent is now years old it would be good if we could both move on rather than rehashing all this nasty crud most of which i have forgotten as i have been busy with a great deal of positive work since thanks,0

edit gwen i edited the personal attack regarding consensus does the term consist of you and name i believe i do have consensus and i would like to understand how and why i dont,0
but coincidence is read the article i referenced by salmon he explains it very clearly it is accessibly on the internet and by the way i am still waiting for those page references from nibley for the matches that you say are suppressed if you cant give a reference then how do i know you are not exaggerating the parallels nibley claims or even making them up this whole debate goes away when you can give us the references required to establish the facts quotes and page numbers so we can cross check selective deletion das i dont appreciate how you are selectively removing my words from the conversations i have posted on this page it appears that you are deliberately trying to cast me in a bad light if you are not comfortable with me posting here then we can move the discussion to my talk page i never delete any posts there and the entire conversation can be preserved once again you are trying to misconstrue my arguments by selectively deleting my posts here i reverted them if you want to remove the conversation then remove the whole thing please,0

fan related links hello all i know some of you may have found my additions irritating on this site more specifically my linking a youtube clip of my friend on the news giving his fresh impressions of the movie just after viewing it let me just say that my friend is a very dedicated fan which the news clip even attests to and although his comments might seem a bit unusual i think theyre interesting in that they speak unique ways a fan could view a movie as far as copyright infringement or irrelevance ive already addressed how the clip is relevant so ill say what i have to on ip having worked in an intellectual property firm for a few years and now as a student in law school i am convinced from what i know of the law that this clip does not infringe upon any rights of the film and any infringement that has occurred thus far from it has been attended to by the abc news team for the release of their story so please can we try to negotiate or come to some sort of agreement that it will be okay to leave this clip up im new to wikiediting but believe this clip would make a nice addition to the spiderman site im sure lots of fans would find it funny and interesting to say the least so what do you say people,0
may utc prince felix of schwarzenburg is at the right location his uncle and then his cousin was the f rst while felixs position all of his life was that of a prinz this distinction is tougher for families where all used f rst like name and also titles like name but it is easily determined i am as certain as you are about name because you moved him to the numeral and the only royalty who used numerals other than the name were the heads of houses and families name name has the wrong nobiliary particle anyway he was zu not von he was also a junior prince because he had an older brother who outlived him who was also the prince name i dont mind leaving the german von or zu for princes of territories if the title isnt used for instance name and prince felix of schwarzenburg would both be acceptable but not a mixture name had an older brother who died after him but a source i have gives names title as f rst which wouldnt make sense i would leave him be for now and ask on his page if he was head of the house name of name is actually the brother in question so logic would mean that he was the f rst but again i would ask on the page name,0

september utc ill try to take the points in turn hope i get this format right wpblpgossip states that be wary of sources that use weasel words and that attribute material to anonymous sources i am not aware of any weasel words or attribution to anonymous sources i am not sure how the section applies if you could be more clear it would be helpful the phrase involve claims about third parties is so vague as to not be any assistance by this metric so little can be used that its almost meaningless someone stating their birthdate or the grade school they attended but for a person saying i have a conflict with name over issue x where do we draw the line it could easily be said that an actor and actress divorcing with one placing on their personal publicist website a statement about separating for reasons of x is a claim about third parties but i wouldnt argue it is unreliable nor unencyclopedic to include in the biography of either individual one can take things too far and i think in this case the avoidance of even mentioning the existence of dispute is getting to the point where people are being literalist and not using their common sense,0

hadnt seen that a lot of material to cover i am getting an education but ill be be plain there has has been a lot of quotation mining on this page from various povs it is what directed me to start reading talk in the first place and to decide to start editing myself good wiki pages demonstrate a synthesis of sources it is easy to spot when that is not happening particularly if you have ever been involved in collaborative writing before a few quick reference checks on the stinkiest stuff such as name appearing to skewer name proves that it is happening all subject matter aside i detest this if someone takes the time to write an academic article or produce a journalistic piece or enter into a public pointcounterpoint debate others who want to reproduce their thoughts have a moral obligation to summarize the original source authentically criticism of it is obviously fine but only after the original piece has been accurately summarized imho,0

i support the idea of wikicode basically i think we should present code in a pythonlike language that doesnt carry so much baggage for example we can use english sentences or sentence fragments instead of requiring the reader to understand some obscure python library further python has the baggage that there are no blockterminators ie no or ends or fis or repeats by adding such terminators we can make it a lot less ambiguous to all readers in otherwords were basically right on track removing the quirks of python and making it higherlevel so i support the idea myself dec utc,0

utc as a close follower of the languagepolitical issues in finland i have always disliked this intentional fudging of mother tongues significance in defining what if you will we could call ethnic identity especially when it comes to finnishspeakers swedishspeakers have identified themselves very clearly as essentially an ethnic group all the way until the latter half of last century when it became much more politically convenient to start pushing the idea of the entire people having two languages which from individual peoples mothertongue point of view is patent nonsense the mother tongue of say my entire family tree is finnish and what swedish they speak has been taught to them at school as essentially foreign language whatever happens in the future our language policy has not yet managed to implant swedish as a general second language in the population and this must be taken into account here i can well understand how name can identify as some sort of particular subgroup and still be considered finnish but there is always the flipside of such a coin august,0

henrietta van laer says no its not that having an agenda at all is a problem for namepedia namepedia has a very clear and unconcealable agenda prosocialists liberals greens and gays determined to vilify and demonize conservatives it is a completely biassed source its articles on socalled leftwing parties are blatant whitewash while those on socalled rightwing parties are nothing but vilification most of it based on flimsy thirdhand sources and malicious allegations with no basis in fact instead of detailing their policies namepedia provides a compendium of prejudice the frequent denials that you have a point of view or that you are biassed are not at all convincing particularly since the whole slant is maintained by a policy of rigorous censorship pov in namespeak different pov to us the namepolice i also get the impression that namepeople are pretty young there is no sign of maturity or experience of the real world in their political views under conservative we find the definition that these parties are merely in favour of the rich how naive can you get i dont know what the term fat cat means in the usa but here in britain it has a very specific meaning ie the people employed in the public sector who get salaries of times the average naturally they are inclined to vote name and can also legally donate large sums to that party then there are a million more people employed in useless quangos which would be abolished by a rightwing taxcutting party many of them earn two or three times the average wage and like the fat cats they get generous pensionpackages too added to the votes of the millions of people who live longterm on state benefits this amounts to a huge vested interest in the socialist programme on the part of people who are neither honestjoe workers or lowpaid but namepedia is still living in a world of student politics with a poster of name on the wall his hair streaming in the wind,0

offensiveness is immaterial your sig is in violation of wpsoap similar signatures have been required to change in the past please change it thank you copied across from my talk i concur with roux wpsoap says having such a line in your signature only serves two purposes the obvious case ie the literal in which case your statement violates wpsoap to offend atheists or people of other religions in which case your signature is divisive and is not permitted whilst it may serve this purpose i understand it probably wasnt intended about billion people are christians that means over two thirds of people living in the world do not believe the same thing as you and will potentially be offended like i was and am it is not an appropriate thing to have in a signature talk,0

listen i know that the english of the article from which is taken the source of the little etymological asertion is a bit idiomatic but if you are a specialist of the greek language and specialist of the history of religions and you have access by your knowledge and all the references in scientific representations about the matter en question then you can verify easily the gravity of an approach that consists on thinking that a simple googling with these words fata morgana coral beads can suffice to do the job no way in the midwhile i would be glad and really happy if you can help me render the meaning of this dificult scientific linguistic idiom that uses the text and keep it in english can you do this with me and for the accessibility of the scientific references in the notes i think that it is the equivalent of the book or other article references its not always accessible and nobody delete them come down this is not possible to delete everything in wikipedia that doesnt appeer to google results or has copyrighted scientifique references,0
youve been overtly harsh with it no need leads often dont have sources your being rather preducice you are the thickest person ever if you cannot read what is impled or understand basic words such as name in a sporting context and thus shouldnt be doing gacs ever level english exactly why you shouldnt be commenting on facs and gacs gee wizz this is why the english wiki is so shit whats going on i asked you to explain your objections a couple of days ago to moving pictures in the golden eagle awards article but you havent i see you have also been asked above to review something but you havent done that either in the meantime you have found time to edit a tonne of other pages and at the top of this page you have a box which says if you want to ask me something please do that soyou seem to have ignored everything and everyonewhats going on,0

editing of name dear phillip my comments regarding your editing of this site are not hostility they are upset i have only ever place three entries onto wikipadia and am the first to acknowledge that i have not made myself fully aware to the protocols of the site after some years of researching my ancestry my primary aim was to share the information garnered on those few individuals who have been somewhat prominent in history my upset comes from the fact that the editing was not sympathetic you seem to have just wiped the article and started again the upshot was that instead of leaving the information on the page after all it has been there for some timewhat is the rush to change it and asking for clarification certain aspects just disappeared if i understand it correctly it seems that wikipedia prefers to quote as a source from the calendars of state papers because a contributor to dnb or odnb a secondary source has seen it and delete my other quote from the calendar of state papers with source referencebecause i have seen it personally in a printed book of the calendars likewise as i mentioned to you in my email it was obvious that the authors of both the old dnb and the odnb did not actually know the origins of colonel namethey both speculated whereas my later research had got nearer to the truth with my finding details given by colonel name to the name when he arrived in ireland with his regiment which you confirmed with the full reference tabdublin national library of ireland genealogical office ms pp certificate of arms to col name of marson in wiltshire and his pedigree he arrived with his regiment in dublin april tabdublin national library of ireland genealogical office ms p certificate of arms and cadency to ensign st john name third brother of and ensign to col name may i apologise if i have been too harsh in my comments to you but you must understand that it was basic sourced information which at the time was not on the internet that i was seeking to share with wikipedia readers not style rules and display i hope you have not finished with your editing if you require any further clarifications please contact me,0
no worries here against readding it i understand where youre coming from i suppose its moreorless common sense to me that its impossible to give someone a warning to stop vandalism if they are not active now with vandalism to give somebody a warning for example to stop eating makes little sense if they are not currently eating thus the socalled warning is not actually a warning at all because there is no logic to hold it together just now however i realize that this is probably quite beyond common sense so i would have no issue if you readd that bit talk,0

unrelated comment a couple of questions and advice since were discussing interesting things to note i have an interesting question open for anyone not just groupuscle if you go to a noticeboard and the consensus is against you will you agree that it is evidence in favor of the position that the articles arent biased or will your opinion continue to be that the articles are pov in terms of trying to reach a rational conclusion its good to answer these questions for yourself beforehand feel free to ignore this of course or to keep the answers to yourself although im also genuinely curious about your answers on the same token even if you dont escalate im always happy to discuss any of my edits or the articles more generally with you or anyone else i am always open to being convinced by sufficient evidence,0
the importance of nameand of anand ponomariov kazimzhinov and topalovin being world champions during a time of crisis for fidecannot be overstated they represent the rule of law the functioning of the world title cycle at a time when it was under direct attack by persons who viewed the title as private property rather than as a sports title bestowed upon a player by a public cycle as it had been from onward to say that fischer name or alekhine were greater playersand therefore of more importanceoverlooks this important aspect of names title reign one could say that fischer name and name were stronger than euwe and smyslov toobut that doesnt get us anywhere we dont rank us presidents by reputation we list them all equally yes name himself in in interviews said that although he was not the strongest player in the world being 44th by ratinghe was clearly the world champion having won the title in the open public cycle run by fide that stand that position is what makes his title reign important btw before anyone denigrates the fide title champions it should be noted that at least two could be considered supergms anand and topalov and that one anand regained the title via the classical method chesspride,0

paleontologists agree that organic remains must be buried quickly so they can be preserved long enough to be come fossilized however the term fossilized is not a very precise term there are several factors and metamorphic mineral processes which occur to organic remains that result in what is typically called a fossil one major factor concerns what kind of organisms are to be fossilized vertebrate invertebrates radiolarians sponges plants pollen foot prints etc and multiple processes may include permineralization recrystalization carbonization replacement dissolving diagenesis etc talking about fossilization is a complex issue however quick burial is not questioned the major question is how long does it take for these processes to work on organic reamins in the environment they are found in experimental taphonomy has resulted in an assortment of remains becoming fossilized by various processes in the lab which of course implies that given the right conditions vast ages are not an issue the metamorphic processes are ongoing until an equilibrium is met between the chemical enviroument of the burial site and the minerals of the organic remains flood catastrophic geologists do not expect that organic remains buried during the flood were completely fossilized within the one year period of the flood but rather that there has been some years for the processes to have been working much more work needs to be done on the taphonomy of organic remains yet how one interprets even those results will depend upon which world view you choose to believe with,0

name was the highest taxing govt in australias history labor then reduced the income tax rate three times since all he did in terms of economic reform was a gst he preferred to play the social conservative while pretending that everything we have around us markets the general direction of ir taxation etc etc is a product of labor which the conservative have always tried to claim the later credit for oh and in modern times slash and burn healtheducationsocialetc services to bring the budget back in to the black even though menzies never had a budget surplus id rather our money spent on us to support australians not held in a surplus gathering dust for no good reason its our money,0

on name qualifications with regards to the edits over the past day i think that while name qualifications are tangentially relevant the purpose of the text as they are placed right now is to prove that name is not qualified to review the autopsy report this i think violates npov if the qualifications are to be included they should come under the criticism and controversy section quoted by whoever it is that accused name of not being qualified to review the autopsy report is cited if nobody made the accusations then this is original synthesis and should again be removed,0

i doubt this will get through your thick head its not an insult its an opinion based on your response but the problem is not the issue itself its that people like you seem to enjoy whether or not your side gets it right to discuss turn twist and frankly abuse topics like this which are detrimental to the basic goals of wikis in general and wikipedia in particular as name said to two hacks youre hurting us,1

reviewing blocks you said id also like to ask you that in future for the sake of fairness and due process that you do not decline the unblock requests of users you block yourself unless the request is pure nonsense or abusive from an ethical reviews of blocks are meant to be carried out by a 3rd party will do i thought it was pretty clear in this case given the editors user page gnaa etc etc etc that the unblock request was pure nonsense also i was under the impression that the unblock request would still be visible and reviewed by other admins ill be more careful in the future,0
what i find a bit strange about the various guidelines and faq pages about categories is that while they contain plenty of fascinating details like hinting at the relationship between graph theory and set theory for no apparent reason they dont really come out and actually say what categories are primarily for helping people find things while this article isnt exactly exclusively about murdered israeli children in the same way that the gaza war and lebanon war articles arent exactly exclusively about children killed by the idf if a reader was looking for the set of articles related to murdered israeli children i think its reasonable to assume that they should be presented with this one rather than not being presented with this one talk,0
impumozhi and his knowledge or lack of about rajputs incident impumozhi accuses rajputs of fabricating history on hada page read this page for a little entertainment in particular the last three sentences setting out the historical repurcussions of that hilarious and probably fictitious incident is this fit for an encyclopedia leave aside veracity just the choice of words yet nobody dare change one comma or fullstop in that page it is owned by that presiding deity of obduracy the learned protagonist of every page with a remote rajput connection impumozhis lack of knowledge exposed his claim about hadas character being funny and unencyclopaedic is actually taken from name annals and antiquities page and volii on the death of the queen name akbar commanded a court mourning and that all might testify a participation in their masters affliction an ordinance was issued that all the rajput chiefs as well as the moslem leaders should shave the moustache and the beard to secure compliance the royal barbers had the execution of the mandate but when they came to quarters of the hadas in order to remove these tokens of manhood they were repulsed with buffets and contumely then enemies of name aggravated the crime of this resistance and insinuated to the royal ear that the outrage upon the barbers was accompanied with expressions insulting to memory of the departed princess who it will be remembered was a rajputani of name akbar forgetting his vassals gallant services commanded that name should be pinioned and forcibly deprived of his moustache he might as well have commanded the operation on a tiger the hadas flew to there arms the camp was thrown into tumult and would have soon presented a wide scene of bloodshed had not the emperor seasonably repenting of his folly repaired to the boondi quarters in person he expressed his admiration he might have said his fear of hada valour alighted from his elephant to expostulate with the name if name thinks this incident is worthy of being mentioned in his book annals and antiquities of rajasthan what is wrong in this incident being mentioned on wikipedia incident deleted the name of famous rajput lady name from rajputani page saying she is not a rajput his response impumozhi on rajputani page deleted the name of name then he was asked why he did so his response was countered on his talk page and till date he has not responded the reason he did not respond is because his lack of knowledge on the topic was thoroughly exposed incident impumozhi tries to get the page of a famous rajput king deleted but is thwarted in another incident he put a tag of dbnonsense on the article name he was asked on the talk page of this article on why he put the csd tag no reasons given till date another user had to remove this dbnonsense tag here again impumozhi had no idea about the subject matter but just because a rajput had created this article he put the dbnonsense tag,0

and of course name is more than just a social anthropologist hes one whose recent research has focused primarily on the social aspects of climate change and is thus at least as qualified to comment on the state of consensus as a historian regarding his study it hasnt been published in a peerreviewed journal but the results have appeared in many reliable sources in effect it should be treated no differently than as if name himself or any other scientist had verbally relayed the conclusions directly to a reporter literally tens of thousands of wiki articles contain such references direct quotes from scientists which appear in no other source but through the medium of a reputable reporter,0

interesting on page of the gross article he did link to a findarticles search that returns empty today previous attempts to deface this page by removing mcdowell link were rebuffed with the claim that name was linking to it it would be surprising that at the time he linked to it findarticles link didnt exist so this may be an attempt to deface wikipedia by erasing internet access to the material,0
the titles need not show that the characters are related all about this is in the articles you see the nature of fiction is that its not necessarily coherent since this article is not about name in the first episode of the show name in the middle but about the character throughout the show it is indeed inaccurate to use a name for the character that was only used for the pilot episode for the entire rest of the seven season run the characters name was only name this is not a question of beauty or taste but of plain accuracy a title like name xxx my appear clumsy but name is not an alternative in my opinion if cant build consensus on this between the two of us i suggest asking for additional input at wikipedia talknaming conventions since i didnt find anything in the guidelines for a specific case like this although im fairly sure the fact that the characters name was name only during the first of episodes of the show means that calling the character name esp in the title is inaccurate,0

karamu high school hi gadfium thank you for starting the page on name but a lot of the informaion is now out of date and the name bot will now administer information for the site thanks preceding unsigned comment added by you are welcome to edit the article but you cannot control it please add only information which can be sourced you also cannot copy information directly from the internet unless that information is under a suitable open content licence usually ccbysa for the section you have copied from the school website to be acceptable you will have to place such a licence statement on that page otherwise you are violating the schools copyright there are alternatives such as proving that you represent the school and have the right to relicence the material which would have to go to someone higher in namepedia than me its much simpler to place a licence notice on the school website you can also rewrite the material in your own words so no copyright violation occurs i suggest you always edit using an account since your ip address may change and that makes it more difficult to establish that the edits are coming from the same person you should also use an account representing a single person not the whole bot see wporgname finally you have a conflict of interest on the article this doesnt prevent you from making purely factual edits but you should not attempt to promote the school by for example using peacock phrases it gets tricky if there is material critical of the school in that case you should add comments on the talk page rather than edit the material directly i accepted the removal of the section on the ero crisis which was unsourced and out of date although quite interesting that was not critical of your school but i think it would have been more appropriate for you to have suggested its removal on the talk page rather than doing so yourselfgadfium thanks for the message not sure where we go to from here or what is your motivation for this name are you a past pupil the bot are confused why you are seeking to edit the name when the school and the bot are the legal owners of the school and its information name happy to stick within the guidelines of namepedia but who is making the judgement calls on what is relevant content eg generally regarded by residents as less conservative where is the evidence ie facts to substantiate this claim who decides karamus alumni all information on our website has been written with bot delegated authority and is the proprty of the bot so no problems there will follow up on other suggestions regarding edit accounts etc when i have more knowledge as still a first time user and know very little apart from the wiki page for khs is simply not an accurate information page for khs in and the bot are not happy as democratically elected trustees of the school to have this continue preceding unsigned comment added by i am not a former student at the school i edit namepedia on many subjects mostly to do with new zealand i am concerned that articles be accurate but i also make sure that no copyright is violated when material is added to articles you are probably correct that the bot owns the school it probably also owns the copyright on the school website it clearly does not own all information about the school and it does not own any namepedia article we cannot allow anyone on the internet to copy material from the schools website to namepedia simply because they claim to represent the bot unless we have proof that they actually do so to put any material on namepedia is to licence it under namepedias terms of use which is under a ccbysa licence i am not allowing the material to be added to namepedia verbatim without such proof because i am protecting the schools copyright the simplest method of providing proof that the material on the school website can be copied to namepedia and any other publisher which wishes to redistribute namepedias content is to add a copyright notice to the page in question saying that the contents are released,0

i was thinking about this last night and came to two conclusions first focusing solely on this article is not the way to go i need to go back to square one and add academic rigor if possible to global warming and denialism dont tell me name is fa and is therefore academically rigorous the fa star does not even come within discusthrowing distance of establishing an article as academically rigorous second your system of defending this wikipedia page notice i didnt say article is completely airtight because you hold control over all of the definitions join any high school debate team and theyll tell you if you own the definitions you own the debate and the problem here is this you define anyone who disagrees with aname as a denialist and you define everyone who agrees with you as an expert done the page is impregnable take forex the quote by democratic senator name using her comments as supporting evidence of the pages not articles thesis is a flagrant act of pov that proves this page not article is an oped piece from start to end name is a politician every bit of power money and prestige she has comes from her ability to do one thing and thing only to characterize herself as a noble public servant and stereotype her opponents as villains buffoons or both even more and this is important name is not a runofthemill politician it would be nearly impossible to find someone more unwaveringly partisan than she is in short the name quote is another bit that does not come close to passing the so what test i intend to delete that one sometime soon too i also wonder whether i should give one of those damn wikicookie templates as a thankyou to the editors who revert me every time they do so or maybe a barnstar i dunno some token of gratitude or other,0

when you look at it in the clear light of day this is an argument in which both sides are doing the same things and making the same counteraccusations it has been resolved to date by the fact that one side of the argument have the power but might doesnt make right who actually started the unreasonable behaviour perhaps the wikipedian who seemed to make the rather ambiguous statement in which he said that the holocaust talk page is not there for discussion well it is there for discussion thats what a talk page is if he meant it is not there for irrelevant discussion he should have stated that explicitly and that having been done be prepared to demonstrate that to anyone who might be in doubt on the matter,0
well the firm had nothing to do with that it was just routine blp work instigated by her personally i suppose she might be doing multiple things to improve the way she is presented online but that hardly amounts to using anyone which sounds like a fairly hostile way to describe an ordinary activity undertaken by all kinds of people all the time in her case specifically the google results are often catastrophic with such gems as slutloadcom you can hardly blame her if she wants to improve the situation,0

fk vardar fk vardar is a macedonian football club the club changed its name several times during its history from original vardar in to name football club vardar or just name name in macedonian in then football club makedonija in and finally back to fc vardar in by the name fc name vardar the club won championships from till about yugoslavia you have to know that yugoslavia was a federation of name countries together and each republic had its own championship and there was a federal league where teams from the name competed together each republic had its own cup and the cup winners competed in the marshals cup that cup was held in honor of name the marshal of the federation and its was called the cup of the marshal how ever fc vardar never won the federal league league made of federation of name best teams thats why its called the federal league and not yugoslavian league nor yugoslavian cup the title in was won by fc name you can check in any official statistics or documents the second federal league was made of two second federal leagues east name competed serbia monte negromacedonia and two provinces almost the same as name but yet without a nation those were kosovo and name and west name croatia bosnia and slovenia sometimes clubs from province name would compete in the west depending on the federation decisions in the period of till present day republic of macedonia was established as provinces within the kingdom of serbs croats and name those provinces were skopje bitolashtip and name prvinces these provinces established the macedonian football federation in and they held championships in these provinces joined in one duchy and this championship was held in the duchy banovina for timesduring the ww2 the championship was held under german occupation and the german government recognized this league after the ww2 the very same championship was tranformed in to republic football league just the province of name was separated from the republic as macedonia transformed from duchy to a republic and the province of name was under the newly made republic of serbia in the bottom line is since the federation of name split in the 90s name was transformed in to macedonian first league so it is the same league that changed names and competition format during the decades and now it came to this level its a petty that there is lots of politics and territorial pretensions lots of denial of the existence of the macedonia and other name in the federation by the serbian side serbian official politic is to show that yugoslavia was one country and nation mainly based on serb character and they are stilling all the history including history of sports in this case football they are trying to show the world that there was yugoslav nation serb and only yugoslav football league serb league denying the federal league second federal league and republic leagues they want to show only yugoslav league and not the real federal league they hold all the champions from the federal league as serbian champions in every competition for fc vardar at this point of view considering that macedonia is not in the federetion for more than yearsand it wont be in the future the most important are the titles and trophies won in the macedonian league and if you wont to put additional trophies won in the federation the period before you should write the precise information second federal league east is the name of the competition and you should put the macedonian flag from that period of the time next to itinstead of the federal flag simply because that federation dont exist anymore and doesnt represent any country nor nation about the cup you should write down the real proper name as it was called marshals cup also fallowed by macedonian flag from that period of the time you should put a notice that in the federal second league east clubs from serbia macedonia and monte negro competed including the provinces of kosovo i name,0

they are all cunts its not worth editing articles here concerning any serious issue all sides consist of either people employed to edit or people with very strong opinions that will never ever change they advocate their stance as something that is interesting to them instead of using the encyclopedia as a book of knowledge and contributing what they are sure to know soon with the centralization of the net into larger and larger sites independent information in general will be extinguished wikipedia a project that started by nerds and professionals within their set fields will become the altar of knowledge where depth and true insight is sacrificed for becoming the sound magnifier of yellow press and popular science the new tool that is intended to auto translate articles from one wikipedia to an other will extinguish the few national wikipedias that through their niche provide those of multilingual capacity an ability to crosscheck facts through other perspectives with few small independent sites left with no or few free university pages left real knowledge will be the privilege of the few that know how to use academic search engines and have the money to pay for them,0
but your addition doesnt say any of that your addition says in the hbo miniseries from the earth to the name a geology professor from caltech met with apollo astronauts and helped to raise their interest in the history and origin of granite he pointed out that without a deep sense of observation the astronauts would just be as good as small robots sent to the moon to collect rock samples all this says is some caltech professor explained rocks and the importance of human observation to the astronauts it certainly doesnt put across the degree of emphasis you suggest here,0

in history there could be a consensus view or a mainstream view in theology there is no mainstream or consensus view since most of theology depends upon the church membership of the theologian historical scholarship aims at universality and objectivity while theology makes no such claims it is true that there are millions who believe that jedp was birthed in hell or would believe it if they knew what jedp means so in principle their view is notable but as enns said it is a fringe view in the academe even among scholars who actually disagree with jedp the sources used to build wikipedia are academic sources therefore jedp and its 21st century offspring are given by default the weight they have inside the academia while the view of the fundamentalists is treated according to wpundue this does not mean that wikipedia could say that the fundamentalists are theologically wrong wikipedia has no theology of its own but it is entitled to say that inside historical scholarship they are a fringe view of course this does not exclude serious scholarship done at religious faculties since as name said in one of his bestsellers us mainline protestant and catholic theological seminaries and divinity schools do teach mandatory historical criticism classes so in a sense scholars from such faculties are thoroughly acquainted with historical criticism and built their careers upon its assumptions only fundamentalist seminaries and divinity schools choose to default against historical criticism they are free to do this but this cuts against their claims of being mainstream historians,0

double standard reloaded who is interested in debating and who is not who is interested in developing the article and who is interested in freezin it to death including using threats and veiled censorship in the form of selective double standard applying of internal rules after all it never too much to remind that an editor besides not been unwilling or unable to counter argue over a year and a half he also have done baseless statements about editions done by me in a certain rude tone during all this time i have responded to him in the same mode but especifically to these assertions not having any left unanswered unlike him and only me is who was warned and blocked curious summary of operations to the newcomers in this discussion and also to the selective forgetful ones see above the heart of this case as well as the sections spurious quotations once again and sections name to judge by yourselves ii in my talk page to note that from grammatical objections to the size of version that i propose no one objection was left standing and even so it continues to be reversed even taking into account that the present version incurs spurious quote in the 1st paragraph too detailed and redundant information for an article that are supposed to be short on the 2nd paragraph and incomplete besides be longer vague and non neutral in the 3rd how not to think in double standard when the last disruptive revertion besides be longer than the version i propose was based entirely on incorrect inferences and historical misconceptions as i shown above again see above points a to e in once again section that were related only to the 2nd paragraph of the version i propose and that no word was uttered against or about the spuriousness that was purged of the 1st paragraph as well as against or about the 3rd paragraph that according to some editor ctr f on word solid to see above on the discussion about grammar in the once again section was pretty solid and even so the revertion was done so i again ask you all is the spuriousness justifiable under any circunstances in the case of an encyclopedia that is intended to be free and neutral which group of honest editors would admit the use of partial referrals that lead to political and historical inferences in favor of a political regime monarchical military etc whatever be worse which group of honest editors would allow the use of spurious citations of a partial source for purposes mentioned above even if this purposes are involuntary although the time that passed without actions having been taken as well as the resistance to remediation maintained only makes this possibility of involuntariness unlikely which group of honest editors ladies and gentlemen who were truly committed to the freedom and neutrality of such instrument would vote against such remediation or would omit about it,0

i dont have desperately strong opinions about what should be included other than the two most widely recognised songs of names solo career however it seems to me that anyone who does have such an opinion ought first to make the case for whichever songs they want include on the talk page in order to gain consensus if any can be reached on that understanding does it seem reasonable to trim the paragraph and leave a note in the article to direct people to the talk page,0

march utc that sentence assumed that there was wrongdoing the rest of that section still implies it by the juxtaposition of the funding information with the report details you may think that this is obvious but we need a source that explicitly states that the findings of the the ut report were influenced by the funding receivedperhaps personal correspondence with the authors of the texas study admitting their findings were indeed swayed by the knowledge that the business interests of major donors to their institution and research programmes would likely be substantially affected in the negative if said findings did not produce a clean bill of health for fracking i mean thats about the only way you could ever meet your demand what an utterly absurd request its easy to see why it was made though just set the bar so high it cant be jumped then use the failure as an excuse to chop out what you dont like maybe youd have me hack the email accounts of the authors fish around for evidence assuming there is even any there then leak it to a major newspaper so they can write an article that i can cite on here only the most naive idiot can fail see the potential for conflict of interest from a study put out by texas the universitys state is the heart and soul of us oil gas but thats certainly not worthy of so much as a mention given that which is also true the university has multimilliondollar and other links with the largest provider of fracking services in the united states not to mention other oil gas companies with interests in fracking i have no idea whether their report was swayed by industry links but only a fool would suggest the potential isnt there if you dont like the juxtaposition just open up a gap with a caveat and make it as weak pathetic and denigrating as you like for all i care maybe something like socialist nay communist campaigners in the pay of a european maoist group have alleged a potential for a conflict of interest noting that for comparison take the recent globalwarming sceptics at the heartland institute as soon as details of the institutes funding were leaked they were prominently reported in the press we dont even need leaks here the information is freely available to anyone who takes the time to find it out as smm201 and others have done all you are interested in doing is eliminating even mention of perfectly obvious potential for conflict of interest according to name we cant even get a decent untarnished report out of the epa unlike texas the epa doesnt even take industry funding for gods sake yet still it cant escape heavy industry pressure to redact aside from irrelevances like minor earthquakes i have no idea whether fracking is causing all the problems it is alleged to though i am extremely suspicious given the documented efforts of industry and their paidfor puppets in government to tone down or eliminate negative findings and the truly just ridiculous claims about frackings potential by people like lord browne here in england and i couldnt care less if frackings safe or not why should i or anyone if its not its not if it is it is outside of a lunatic asylum who would care if it is safe enough bring it on jobs tax receipts increased energy security reduced use of coal burning only a fool wouldnt be interested in those things particularly given the current economic situation what i dont like are those desperate only to hear what they want to hear making up totally unreasonable tests so they can get rid of what they regard as offending material,0

i understand the confusion you would think that since a primary source is a firsthand account it would be the most reliable however the person or group involved could have a biased viewpoint also there may be multiple viewpoints on the event in question that differ from one another thats when a secondary source comes in a secondary sources author is one step removed from the event reducing the chance of bias and often uses several primary sources to form an opinion evaluation andor conclusion furthermore secondary sources are more likely to be published the editorial oversight of the publishing process is extremely valuable here it helps us avoid original research one of the biggest problems with wikipedians relying on primary sources is that they often find themselves forming their own conclusions whether intentionally or not which would be considered original research you can read more about why published sources are sought on wikipedia at wprs and wpsource,0

welcome to the crazy world of cyrillic reference to your claim about different spelling tundja or name etc etc municipality website spells the village name as source wiki perhaps their jest on a nation whom refuses to check check and check again the first link is a correct spelling for the village present the spelling is with zh and the new cyrillic sign posts are shortened as metal theft was a problem thats removed now that a population no access to scrap yards on street view attain lots of vines many kms of vines a fact one could from that perhaps then conclude a winery existence this is the case the novinite article is factual that winery was modernized your claim of that first link is to a different village of similar spelling which is in the same city display these similar named villages again are using your power i think this is abuse backup your statement please,0

title of article in english wikipedia this morning a wikipedian moved this page to a version including the full vietnamese diacritics i just moved it back to the version without diacritics for the following reasons this is the englishlanguage article about ngo and the great majority of english text written about ngo and other vietnamese generally do not include diacritics in english in fact inclusion of the diacritics is of no effect at best or even confusing because they have no effect on pronunciation in standard english orthography please note i am by no means an englishlanguage bigot i am a student of the vietnamese language and understand the fundamental role diacritic marks fulfill in correctly differentiating phonemes in vietnamese however it is clear that in english the diacritics play no role in pronunciation the wikipedia guidelines on naming conventions asserts that the most commonly used spelling in english is the form that should be used apr utc,0
for what purpose was the us census office reinterpreting a foreign census my hunch is that spoken name and western ukrainian are closely related for example my father learned polish at home from his mother he was a pennsylvania coal miner and understood name after working years underground i remember him saying that the names did not like to be referred to as ukrainians if he were alive today he would understand this discussion dr name please cite a reliable source from the cold war era on this name and ukrainian dispute we are having here in new york the local names and ukrainians are happy like peas in a pod see ukrainian americans in new york city if you are in ny drop me a line and we can have lunch there regards,0
im sorry you are wrong on both counts name is a different dialect to name as you have said the other dialects from the area are makem and pitmatic name being the accent that is common in the larger part of northumberland i being from northumberland myself actually know what i am talking about if you live in rural northumberland bearing in mind that the shire as northumberland is a shire county is mostly rural you would have a different dialect to someone from newcastle prudhoe or name as the inhabitants of these places generally speak with a name accent also no serious linguist would call all these different dialects name i have heard them grouped as name dialects but not name dialects calling them name is correct for two reasons one being that all these dialects come from the area that is known as northumbria that is northumberland durham newcastleetc on the other point you are mistake name though not the whole uk can be rightly called a name nation it is true blood is not the deciding factor as you say though it is connected in some ways however traditions language laws and history are name was of course founded byyou guessed it name tribes whether they are the predominant dna is besides the point these tribes were the angles saxons jutes and frisians you cant deny this as before the english kingdoms name did not exist our language is obviously name though it has borrowed from other languages over the centuries it is still west name most of our common traditions such as yule yule itself is a name word derived from the norse jul are name the eating of a christmas ham mistletoe christmas trees nameetc are all name many of our laws come direct from anglosaxon and danish laws though i agree many were modified by the normans who though descended from norwegians are not culturally name as for selfidentity i would say that the english identify themselves with name culture albeit in a subliminal way for example the fact that they use anglosaxon to describe themselves is an indication of this they are identifying with tribes that were danish and northern german and thus name so on that score yes the english are a name people and as you bring up dna casually then firstly i will point out that it isnt proven either way whether the anglosaxon dna is more prominent or whether the british used in this sense as preanglosaxon is different surveys have different results and none have actually been accepted by all experts and for the most part many of the newer surveys still show that in the north east of name the name percentage is higher than the british thus the predominant dna is name the main problem is that it cannot be determined whether it is anglosaxon or danish viking blood but this does not make any difference to whether the blood is name i dont care whether the modern english have british or anglosaxon blood as i am partly norsegaelic and partly englishthus being a mix i just do think that the anglosaxon blood is prominent as do many experts in north eastern name either way name blood or british bloodthe english are ethnically name note i am not going to lie and say i am not proud of name culture as it is obvious especially by my username but i do consider myself british as the uk isnt about one ethnicity or culture but about the union of many and i am proud of that also and by the way there is a good case for northumbria being one of the more name parts due in a large part to its folklore especially its creatures that include name which they are actually calledthey are dwarves and name or more correctly name as they are in old english who are known by the common english word elf but are the older and if i may say more correct type,0
witch images im sorry im not entirely certain what youre saying are you saying that we should use pictures from the comic book or the series but not both or is there a specific picture that you have an issue with all of the pictures are from the comic book except the one of the former guardians which is from the series as the page is about the series i would have preferred to use pictures from the series but i dont have any nearly as good as these and none actually showing each family together,0

definitely need to start a talk page for this one i unfortunately dont know the specifics of wikipedia but isnt there a request you can stick at the top of the page for someone with some expert opinion to edit this it reads like an essay and is therefore pitched for someone at a particaulr level and is completely inaccessible as an introduction in fact its not introducing anything its just describing the features typical bloody student essays just like the ones i write so i unfortunately know the problems too well,0

users using sockpuppets in this discussion note that user nightscream is soliciting sockpuppets of toure neblett to join this discussion name this isnt surprising considering nightscreams slimy debating tactics and ad hominem smears it looks like the reality is that there are only one or two actual people opposed to teh inclusion of the last name and the rest are their sockpuppets though i guess it demonstrates that name is not one of toures own sockpuppets fyi i am not using a user name in this simply to make it clear i am not a sockpuppet,0

you said i am determined that the page will not regress to this again and i will delete anything inappropriate that jeopardizes the good progess that is now being made a completely inappropriate post in the middle of a sensitive discussion threatens to do just that the problem is that you are not the sole arbiter of this or any talk page the post was innocuous and did not violate the conditions of the arbitration decision nor did it affect the flow of discussion on the page in fact the most appropriate response would have been to just ignore it by removing it you just encourage a reaction you accuse me of wikilawyering which is absurd the guidelines are there to help us all however not only do you violate that guideline but also several policies it is this kind of heavy handed action that encourages people to persist with problem edits it is a longstanding convention that we do not remove other users posts and in my three years here i have never seen it done when it wasnt vandalism unless you can give me a much better reason for not doing so i am going to reinstate the deleted text,0

anyone have any thoughts on the addition of name to the list of notable metaphysicians since name name are listed and name is clearly in this trajectory of catholic philosophers i thought he would be a good addition to the list his work is wellregarded in 20th century philosophy he certainly has the credentials and i think many would agree he made highly significant contributions to metaphysics by extending the core ideas of aristotle name and name forward in the areas of cognitional theory epistemology and verifiable metaphysics based on the data of consciousness and his study of methodology in mathematics and empirical science see insight a study of human understanding there are name centers at boston college university of toronto name and loyola marymount university devoted to studying and extending his works in philosophy and theology im quite sure nearly every philosophy professor at any jesuit schools would consider his work notable my attempt at this addition was reverted as not particularly notable as a metaphysician so thought i would throw it out there,0

even the claim of essentially segregated lives is bogus of course lives arent integrated since these are two different cultures with different customs and languages but what separation exists is purely voluntary some arabs prefer to live in an arab townvillage and thats understandable most arabs send their kids to arab school so they can study in arabic however some send their kid to a hebrew speaking school i had an arab classmate for instance whose father was a department head in the city hospital by the way many arabs live in towns with a jewish majority and theres no law against that and no one prevents them from doing so several cities in israel have substantially mixed populations including jerusalem haifa name name name name and others theres no segregation and no separation,0

editing edits on wiki improve by evolution only the best survives they become best by change after change after change i find i make two kinds of edits ones which add content and ones which improve language i fancy i am quite good at writing smooth prose but very often it is not possible to do this immediately if i have a fact to insert or point to make the primary thing is to make or insert it then someone else can smooth it along or i may do so myself when i have more time or after leaving the piece and rereading it it can be quite difficult to write good prose in one go because you do not spot your mistakes as to our last exchange in severus snape yes i agree i put in a clumsy statement but i was trying to express a particular point you improved the flow but slightly altered my point i changed it again back a little to my original intention though you also added something cheers,0

hm and for the claim that it was the work of an outside hacker intruding upon the university of east anglias climatic research unit in a skulking smashandgrab to come up with this carefully structured foia2009zip archive predominantly consisting of data files and computer code with a gracenote minority of emails showing how utterly rottentothecore are the correspondents responsible not only for running the cru but also the realclimate agw fraudsters propaganda blog we have only the claims of the university of east anglia officers responsible for running the cru and the proprietors of the realclimate sack of feculent lies you wikinazi watermelon scum want to think this over a bit,0

frankly this is a waste of everybodys time it serves no purpose to repeat the arguments against inclusion over again full in the knowledge that you will not accept them your spiels of wikilawyering have demonstrated very little on the whole you have consistently failed to assume good faith and you have not convinced anyone that your biased original research belongs in the article you claimed that four days ago you did not know what a talk page was yet you are now lecturing users who are far more experienced than you in these matters on your beliefs on wiki policy we havent moved on significantly if you cannot accept that on controversial articles the standard of challenged or likely to be challenged is higher than elsewhere then you are in no position be lecturing policy to us wpucs is a guide an essay not policy in any case common sense dictates that on controversial articles material is more likely to be challenged than on noncontroversial ones this is challenged material and you require a better cite than the ones you gave us the material has implications for npov these are the facts that are relevant here a long circular argument on talk helps noone talk,0

sorry your protest goes unnoticed for you to protest about my characterization there would have to be a qualified adjective next to your name or a description of a series of actions grounded on blatantly false information what i claim is that you are reengaging in a series of edits and deletes which is factually correct and therefore morally permissible i take no sides i see things how they are you never cite your sources and as such i do not feel compelled to prolong my answer any further good day per wikipedia policy i am letting myself know that i am one of the designated mediation parties for a current article dispute,0

name article and incessent pov vandalism how dare you put this notice on my talkpage simply for my efforts to add some responsible balance to the article on name which now reads as a unadorned love letter to ie whitewash of a performer with profoundly racist and fascistic views names groupies on this board such as felixfelix and edna spennato a close personal friend of name have been relentlessly censoring and reverting all the documented evidence that puts their hero in a less than fully flattering light it is therefore they who are the major perpetrators of pov vandalism to that page your hideous targeting of me a dedicated antiracist and antifascist activist shows either complete ignorance on your part or a bias that ultimately enables nazi racists attempting genocide if you do not remove this harrasement from my talkpage i will be contacting the relevant higherups at wikipedia,0

hmmmm are you suggesting stripping discussion of the pentarchy in the lead or are you suggesting different phrasing if so what do you recommend my understanding is that it was constantinoples position that rome objected to which granted was at the core of names pentarchy but not the idea of the patriarchate system as a whole even so though its not like rome pulled out of future councils or in any other substantial ways severed itself from the emperor at that time in other words it is certainly true that there were many violent disagreements some of which led to temporary schisms but to my understanding names system even if not everybody liked it became a practical reality one that indeed helped fuel the fire that pushed rome further and further away,0

this is becoming very tiresome after the last reasonable attempt at compromise to keep one person name happy as well as everyone else by making the language neutral name returned to remove an important qualifying word some and to change parliament to government and to delete documenting links that shows lack of good faith and also lack of understanding of parliamentary government regarding the first point to criticize a mullah or a priest is not to criticize islam or christianity and to criticize one activist in a movement is not to criticize the antiwar movement that is simple dishonesty to claim otherwise regarding the second point in a parliamentary system the word government refers to prime minister and cabinet not to members of parliament to advise government you are advising the prime minister nothing states that palmer ever met the prime minister but he spoke to members of the parliament name is perhaps no political scientist but there is a major difference between them even under the american system if someone speaks to members of the congress it would be dishonest to write that she or he had come to washington to advise the government we had reached a compromise and name indicated that he could live with it but he has now gone in without any reason and changed the entry to be misleading the agenda at work seems more to defame a person than to provide neutrally articulated information the issue is raised and its time for name to simply back off others here will have to revert his attempt to introduce errors into this entry,0

indeed learning curve i am amazed at how much learning i had to do in order to get the wiki privatized and fully operationalfirst off i wanted to make an ironcladsecurity main page like arbcom s wiki that wasn t too terribly difficult but there is a gaping hole in mediawiki s security in the default installation whereby all uploaded files generally images in a completely private wiki can be directly accessed by anyone familiar with mediawiki merely typing a url path that took some reading and trial error mediawiki s excuse is that mediawiki is designed to be open to everyone maaaan it s like about openness the thing is those who don t care to think about security wouldn t mind if images cannot be viewed via intelligent url typing however those making a private wiki who do care wouldn t want them viewable by ipsand then thumbnails of images wouldn t work no matter what i did to localsettingsphp file like many things i would go to talk pages on mediawiki and discover there have been many others wrestling with the same issues it turned out that imagemagick has been omitted from recent builds of mediawiki moreover installing imagemagick isn t a matter of dropping files and folders into the wiki using ftp it s a linux installer rpm and only the webmaster can do thatand after all that is done there are bunch of gottahave templates like templatext template templatedoc templatehilite templatenbhyph templatenowrap and templatename i think i have all the gottahaves now i was the shepherding authorsponsor on a bunch of them so i m fond of themi can t complain about free stuff mediawiki is an amazing product that few commercial interests could match for under i ll take the poor documentation associated with opensource software any day,0

july utc i didnt say that the summary attribute is not working i said that it was marked as obsolete obsolete in this instance means that browsers claiming compliance with html need not support it and people writing pages that claim compliance with html should not use it but most browsers that support html also support html not just because it will take a long time for everybody with a website to rewrite the content for html if it ever happens there are still a lot of html or compliant pages out there that would fail a conformance check for html let alone html but also because html has not yet reached the w3c recommendation stage so the current stable standard is html on some discussion pages i know of at least three threads outside of user talk space there is a scaremonger going around telling people to stop using the element asap because its marked as obsolete in html dont panic it still works in every browser ive tried it in though and will probably do so for a long time yet,0

dunfermline article and new pictures for the name collage hello again ive been looking at the paragraph about the name shopping centre on the economy section both sources do not indicate that the shopping centre was built in the 1980s nor is there any reference to the centre car park having two levels me and you know that the centre was built in the 1980s specifically between and if you want make reference to it use a century of dunfermline or dunfermline the postwar years but then i never thought it was that important how old the centre was anyway about the two levels on the car park it is actually three if youve read the sources also i think you should reinstate info on the actual size of the extension and where this took place you might also want to say that the extension was built on the site of the old bus station and car park info is there on the reference name extension on schedule for august opening by name as we both probably want to get this article to ga i would remove all references to the word locate within that section this is one of many words or phrases that should be avoided if aiming for ga status thats why when i originally wrote that paragraph on the name and other retail areas i specifically kept the use of the word in question to a minimum if it isnt dealt with now it will be at a later date that aside i have a new picture of the beveridge park which i submitted to name home page it is now on his talk page if you want to see it name thinks it is a good effort and i would like to add it to the collage to replace the picture of the beveridge park pond as well as this i have another new picture of the old name which was inspired by one on the undiscovered scotland website the clock has been restored since that pic and would like to upload it,0

hi math thanks for the page with the pictures of her art i find it very interesting her pictures of womens bodies as commodities are very disturbing while her photos of morrissey are beautiful i really want to get my hands on the morrissey shot book but i couldnt order it from amazon apparently they cant ship it to my country anyway i know what youre talking about information on linder and ludus is very hard to find besides the ludus biography you quoted ive come across a couple of articles about an exhibition she did in the guardian article name and here is a long and indepth article her real name is name the guardian article gives info on her date and place of birth liverpool and a bit on her background i have some pictures from ludus sleeves that i might include in the article besides the importance of being morrissey linder also appeared in name on the smiths what other magazine articles have you found about her shes usually mentioned in connection with morrissey and even that is very rarely the only magazine article i can think of is that infamous name the face article on the smiths there are also a few pages about her in the severed alliance but its similar stuff as in that ludus biography you posted the link to plus some interesting quotes by name and trotter apparently her flat in whalley range was sort of a bohemian haven for many musicins and artists they also claim she had quite an influence over men in her circle that name wrote buzzcocks what do i get as a plea of unrequited love for her and that she inspired a lot of devotos early work her name also pops up a lot in songs that saved your life besides cemetry gates shes mentioned in entries for miserable lie wonderful woman last night i dreamt that somebody loved me in connection to a weird matrix message that was initially supposed to be on the single and i wont share you in the latter theres another quote from the unused morrissey sleeve note for the cancelled name restrospective the end of the note sounds very familiar oh linder oh linder ill see you sometime somewhere however im not sure if you should mention any of this stuff in an article for one thing it comes close to or falls directly into the realm of speculation on personal matters then again its not like wikipedia articles do not include speculation and rumours morrissey page is one of the examples but it would be wrong to make it seem as if she is more important for her relationships with male musicians than for her own work so i dont know,0

why confusion and controversy in the real world does not preclude the writing of a good wikipedia on the topic name suggests that because the real world has not yet hashed out the truth about the expulsions it is therefore impossible for us to know the truth and thus impossible for us to write about it i reject such a stance i think it is difficult but quite possible to write a quality wikipedia article about a topic that is murky andor controversial where many wikipedia editors get it wrong is that they believe wikipedias job is to report the truth this is wrong wikipedias job is not to report the truth precisely because it is difficult to determine what the truth is any attempt to do that is original research instead of truth wikipedia aims for verifiability put a different way wikipedia is committed to recording the state of human knowledge and opinion not our opinions but those of reliable sources if the truth is clear and uncontroversial it is easy for us to report that if the truth is murky and controversial it is more challenging but possible for us to report on what different reliable sources assert and think about a topic even if these reliable sources conflict where wikipedia editors get into trouble is when they start siding with one side of a controversy and asserting that the side that they have selected represents the truth and not just one perspective or pov on the topic at hand i have been trying to hit this npov sweet spot but it is difficult to do so in the midst of a running polemical debate between the two sides obviously is because some users name and wikiferdi dont want to discuss in fact they want us to agree with their pov thats not discussion about the npov edits thats why i quit from the discussion about the form of the article talk,0

if you continue to editwar over this article i may ask that sanctions be taken against you wikipedia articles should be based on thirdparty reliable sources not on data derived solely from the website of the article subject frankly there is little in the article to suggest that it meets our notability guidelines at all i suggest you study the relevant parts of wikipedia policy and fins sources to confirm notability regarding the article topic rather than editwarring over inadmissible content,0

name hi the idea about an article is a good one but unfortunately youve started out with an error that is understandable as the subject is complex the wagr first imported the m class names in these are very important locos because they are the third class of name to be built and the first main line name showing the potential as a heavy freight hauler they were followed up in by the ms class only difference being the ms class were superheated so they were also the first class of names to be the subject of a repeat order both classes were built by beyerpeacock the name class were constructed in by the wagr in their own workshops apparently a copy of the ms class they did seem to have some cosmetic differences the story does not end there but moves to victoria the vr g class apparently is copied from the ms class the major difference is the frames moved outside so as to accomidate the reduced gauge outside framed names are very rare even in the smaller gauges but wait there is more no not steak knives the design was used again for the australian portland cements line near geelong the first loco being supplied in and the second in the boiler from one of these locos is used on the restored g42 so in conclusion the design was constructed over a period of years used on three railway on two gauges and built by two manufacturers with if ive added it up correctly locos constructed personally i think the article should cover the history of the design and include all the varients some work would be required to hunt down variations though so yes i think it does deserve an article please feel free to use the above if you wish name name,0

whilst dr name asked only that we take down the bdiii i still have to pay a copy for the original bdii so i must assume thats under copyright and licence as well im going to try and find some relevant bits from wpc to justify or not removing the links from what i can see the relevant text is here linking to copyrighted works external sites can possibly violate copyright linking to copyrighted works is usually not a problem as long as you have made a reasonable effort to determine that the page in question is not violating someone elses copyright if it is please do not link to the page name and intentionally directing others to a site that violates copyright has been considered a form of contributory infringement in the united states intellectual reserve v utah lighthouse ministry also linking to a page that illegally distributes someone elses work sheds a bad light on us if the site in question is making fair use of the material linking is fine from what i can tell i think that the sites that are hosting the bdii and bdiii are violating copyright most of them dont say that they have permission to use the instrument they dont cite the original paper and in the licence when you buy a copy it explicitly says not to make electronic copies now each of these separate users may have made a licence deal with harcourt individually but it seems unlikely a lot of the google hits that come up are appendices and lecture notes from university projects i dont think there is an exemption for educational use but then university psychology departments often buy a portfolio of test copyrights for limited use this would not normally extend to use on the web however in terms of next steps i actually think this is one of the rare occasions where a consensus is not the way to go but rather we could list the issue at wpcp if its an issue of helping depressed people im not sure having people just fill out the form will do them much good after all it just produces a number its only useful in context one option would be to have a link to a therapeutic community as these may be of some help for instance name is a site which allows users to selfadminister cognitive behavioral strategies will go next to typewritten letter from name about cycad toxicity in guam and the link to als,0

a theory is comprised of research findings you are talking about research findings and theory as if they were two separet things there is no distinction between research findings and theory what they first two comments are telling is that the research method and the theory should be split into two articles the research method is called social network analysis and the theory is called social network theory a researcher uses social network analysis to produce information about a phenomenon called social network and the sum of findings constitute social network theory therefore there is no distinction between theory and research findings but there should be a distinction between a sepecific research method and a theory thus the article whould be split into two articles as social network and social network analysis,0
unblockill make a renewed effort not to give personal attacks but of course i do have some questions about this unwarranted blockage as you might well imagine why is it that ip editors tend to get the raw ends of the deal that you admins tend to lean towards the side of someone whos editing with an account over someone whos editing without one especially in the area of what you label as personal attacks or harassment when given by the ipeditor but not so much when the named editor does the same thing for exampleand this is yep maybe you guessed it question why is it supposedly okay according to you for someone with a name like say name orbit to dish out a personal attack but not for me to give him one back because im just a lowly ipeditor specifically why is it supposedly okay for him to give me a personal attack by putting false stuff on my keyboard by making the ludicrous claim that my reason for wanting the old style of ebay logo to go next to the current one ebay in the lead is because i wanted it in there even though that is a total lie but its supposedly not okay for me to call that kind of slander stupid heres another one why is it supposedly okay for him and name girl there to falsely accuse my edits of being vandalism just because they differed from what these guys preferred but then when i say their reversions are vandalism i get in trouble for it as if it were a personal attack just because im an iponly editor ready for one more then why is it fine for any of you named editors to give one of us ipeditors a warning template but when i as an iper do the same thing to a named editor like i did to partially name girl i get dinged with oh you cant do that cause thats a personal attack or oh thats bad because thats harassment oh yeah heres one more remember the rule about editwarring just in general meaning that it doesnt even have to be breaking 3rr that says that but i was right so i was not editwarring is no defense well then doesnt that apply to meeting some socalled consensus too since some things arent cases of concrete correctness but are just based more on whether they match what that socalled consensus wanted the thing to say well then why is it that just because your named friend name there does some editwarring against me to put the thing back to what your exclusive partial consensus wants it to say and since my editing had already been established as not vandalism even though it disagrees you ignore that abovementioned editwarring rule and give herhim a pass anyway but when i an iponly editor whos against your exclusive consensus do the same thing its editwarring even though it was the same thing as what names doing remember the beingrightmatchingconsensusisnodefense rule,0
outdent how about looking at it like this name are just that the rulebook explains how to play the game but it is not the game itself the isbn manual you reference below supports this games shall not be given isbns there may be some confusion in the matter but one good example is found by harking back to add name to play that game required it being rules heavy that really is pretty much true a minimum of two books the dm guide and the players handbook neither contained the game and the game went far beyond what was in either the game in all its entirety encompassed the contents of many books magazine articles supplements pamphlets online articles and what was in the head of the players the book is about the game it is not the game for that matter a number of the articles you tagged did not list an isbn so you cant really claim that you claimed it was a book in ignorance because of the isbn a publisher doesnt mean its a book as board games computer games and any number of things are published and have publishers,0

managing the content of articles when a plant product whether food or other is not in a relationship with botanical taxa is always a problem here it seems clear that a separate article on the plant product is the right approach theres bound to be some overlap with genusspecies articles this article seems to me about right in its focus on what englishspeakers normally mean by banana namely the food where it comes from what it is how its grown etc it would be possible to move some the taxonomy material to name genus perhaps with some crossreferencing so that the article concentrates more on the food and agricultural aspects of the topic but this would be a marginal change,0

hello barto i am curious as to what your motivation is in editing on the name page and are you the creator of it as stated on the talk page there you are correct in stating that internet sources which are few come from mostly the extreme right or left these are terms both i and name himself would acknowledge as being artificially misleading characterisations and could not be ascribed to him or the associates of the canadian league of rights i could explain why here but i wont bore you with the details however i do reject the notion that everything must link to a wiki article i am editing at another page where there is no objection to verifiable external sourcesinternet or hard copy i will not object to socalled left or right sources as long as there are sources from external links to associations and people connected to mr name the archives at the australian league of rights will have plenty of published materials on him league objectives and views or anyone associated with him this is one link that was removed in favor of name document hardly a nonpolitcally unbiased character considering he represents everything the opposite of what name and the league of rights stood for i will try to help you find sources fair and credible in the near future doing edits myself i just want to know if you have a bias of your own or are willing to be neutral on some claims made about him i know well what he and the league of rights stand for as i have been involved with it for near yrs there is no denying he was antitotalitarianism and that includes antizionist which automatically brings down the bogus smear of antisemitism and other such nonsense an editor should have at least some familiarity with the subject he is decidedly determined to write about i have notified name of the wiki page and link to him at names page in case he didnt know it existed be aware that wikipedia has come under criticism for pages created on living persons edited by vandals with damaging false claims unknown to the subject of the article until much later one was a recent highlevel member of the name administration and believe me he made a public stink about it living or dead i dont care to see this happen to anyone feel free to post at my page in answer if you wish do you have a wiki email or a private one,0

and this is why i think youve got blinders on the cites arent for headline usage only perhaps you missed the cite for the observer england july which uses hp for name in the article text not in the headline and doesnt ever spell out name it uses hp only or the atlanta journalconstitution july which spells it out hp name in the text not in the headline heres a new one going the other way personally i reckon youre either a fellowship of the rings fotr fan or a name hp girl in this instance a bit of owning up has to be done ive read all the hp books the sunday telegraph january thats also in the text not in the headline if that will help ill add it to the other discussion as well i stopped digging them up since it was unclear what the problem with the existing cites was,0

the article is mostly about the pound in general with no massforce distinction due its historical treatment as a weight perhaps the numerous incarnations of the pound should be in a generic name article and name mass should be in a similar category to any other unit of mass in a specific system in this case the name mass is a member of the fps gravitational system of units there should be a link to the name mass article from the name article of course but it deserves no better treatment than the lb of the fps engineering system there is a table of the fps systems at nameforce and at slug mass which tabulates various fps systems its a little less clear than it used to be what was simply called fps engineering is now engineering absolute and the fps gravitational system of units is apparently clambering for some credibility by calling itself the engineering gravitational system which of course has no use in engineering due to its offence to newtons 2nd law where did the gravitational system come from maybe some reliable sources are in order,0

okay for many of my thoughts on wikipolitics you can read my request for adminship the best feeling is undoubtedly seeing someone read an article youve written or complimenting it my advice would be to never forget that however bogged down in the political posturing you find yourself several of our best contributors plug away behinds the scenes day after say unseen and unheard are there any areas that youd suggest i look into in particular nice try but youre going to have to find that out yourself you may find that joining a wikiproject can be a useful step in an area that interests you be warned though some are more active than others what things really annoy you about wikipedia which parts do you think could work better in some ways the single thing that annoys me most is the assumption that wikipedia is broken and needs to be fixed its never going to be perfect so we may as well enjoy it now rather than focussing on some random point in the future when everything will be just right in the uk sign,0

discussion boards are almost the lowest form of life on wprs only just above comments sections on blogs however if you can demonstrate that glf has written this and the fact that it has appeared under his name on a forum that he has moderating rights on may indicate this although he does not use a stared account which means it could be an imposter the daily mirror account seems to be totally derivative of the guardian and the guardian does not say that glf was a member of the bnp just that their journalist contacted him and he said that he could not be active the daily mirror could well have lost the subtelty of what the guardian said i wouldnt like to be their libel lawyer on that with all of this and knowing glfs propensity to sue i am going to cut this out the fact that the cda is to the right of the conservative party is pretty well established in the article,0

the othello error ekman refers to the sheakspeares play of othello killing his wife who he suspected to love another man all this based upon his wifes distress failing to listen to her alternative innocent explanations the interpretation of behaviour when a subject under questioning show signs of fear andor distress it could indicate the subject is not telling the truth the othello error refers to the fact that honest people may experience fear during questioning and show signs of fear while perfectly telling the truth in essence you can not rely entirely on signs of fear as an indicator of truth or lie you have to look beyond the signs,0

well to respond to your question directly i would mention name commentary are rarely reliable for statements of fact or the reporting of rumors has a limited encyclopedic value but be it that or be it mentioning wpbiased was here more for the form i have never really understood the foundation of this being here my question therefore would be why are you opposing the correction of an unsourced unsigned and incorrect as per its own definition piece of information it can not even be referred to as a controversy since it is absolutely not a state of prolonged public dispute or debate so what is the reason you would find this is a correct encyclopedic information,0
we should not have religious beliefs evolution or creationist beliefs brought into wikipedia on edits we need a nice neautral position not in favour of any of them sticking to objective data and not subjective viewpoints the user in dicussion here deals with subjectivity only anything which opposes his own faith is deleted reverted etc i can not bring this up anymore this is all he does on wikipedia confirmed by his history the user in question is your best friend fair play if there was a conscience at play here someone would do something about it but nobody else is looking into this except yourself so you will obviously win this by position of authority winning as i could easily obtain a ban this place is not neutral i will stay inactive for a year and come back later when things are more fair on here,0

i think most people who have studied name in any depth have run across very occasional claims for his innocence to be perfectly frank proponents of this view are treated with the same disdain as holocaust deniers no i dont find anecdotal reference to a report that a near contemporary of name entertained doubts as to his guilt at all interesting de rais was a name of france after all there were bound to be some who could not countenance the idea that he was capable of such crimes and as for that book on name you allude to in support of the mans innocence whose title you cannot even remember how marginal and tangential can a publication be to the case of name than a putative book on bart k,0
and use the confusing redundent yet common phrase north america not refering to the continent either of two reasons a desire to place the united states last on the list by manipulating the names of regions to exploit the fair use of alphabetization to make the us hard to find simply an oversight well nobody replied so i renamed the section on territories and regions to un subregions its amazing that this list puts the united states last even though it has most of the people and of the area is someone trying to deemphasize americas importance no its just in alphabetical order talk about any info in this article about the use of the term as if it meant exclusively canada and the united states yes in the human geography section namely the 3rd paragraph other related terms are also treated in that sxn talk central americans are not north americans we are own people and we are not northerners we are seperate from them and are nothing like them you can try to correct me but the people who say that we are north americans are white folk who try to keep us down and sometimes other ignorant groups of people i will never surrender to being north american and nor should any other central american should ever buy into this i dont care what the white man tells us theyre not us we should be able to decide for ourselves who we are and no else should tell us who to be this is just another way of bringing us down i am proud of being central american and being someone who inhabited this land long before the white people made contact with us if we have been living here for the longest time should it not be us who decides who we want to be name this is a lovely essay but unfortunately you cannot undeclare yourself a north american any more easily than you can underclare yourself an earthling central america happens to be located in north america so central americans are north americans its a geographical thing not a cultural thing perhaps youre thinking of latin america and anglo america actually name can undeclare himself if youll check the spanish wikipedia articles on central america and north america you will see that spanish language defines north americas southernmost country as mexico esname redirects to esname which lists the lists the following political units in north to south order greenland canada united states mexico note that central america is not on this list name is also right as far as english language goes north america includes mexico and central america i think america terminology should provide a better explanation than it currently does a section on english vs spanish terminology would help i dont speak spanish but i studied french in high school and can sometimes puzzle out the meaning maybe ill recruit some bilingual wikipedians to help me write this okay but ill claim the fatal flaw here is this name is a spanish term that is different from the english term north america name may not be a norteamericano although i dont think he declares himself here either doesnt spanish have an equivilent to name but hes still north american actually i dont think north american is an identity that applies to latin americans his country if its in central america is a part of the north american continent but the cultural division is what hes concerned about want to help me update america terminology i think america terminology reflects correct english usage maybe use of the word american is a better place to move these kind of complaints although im actively involved in that article and know itll get shot down as original research roughly speaking there arent political continents wikipedia has articles on anglo america not that im convinced the term exists in contrast,0

how did you decide that bukkake always implies a female subject also just because a word has a historical meaning doesnt mean that it cant ever mean anything else as culture develops the word rap meant to knock as on a door up until the late 70s for example would you deny the more modern use of the term the english language has no board to regulate it as french does with the name fran aise so you have no basis for defining what the word means we have groups and documents that define the proper use of words like youre and your for example but none such for words like bukkake if it can be shown that it is used in a particular way that is valid my personal belief is that there is no need for the qualifier gay just as there is no need to call men having anal sex gay anal sex but thats really irrelevent i think it is important to make clear the historical implications but not to deny that we are currently creating and modifying language even the fact that we have taken the word bukkake splash from japan and created this very specific connotation of splashing not just anything but specifically semen and specifically onto a persons face shows that this term is elastic and subject not to rules that we impose on it but by the meaning that it has to the people who use it,0

a problem with english patriot man and his sockpuppets hi lately ive seen you blocking some sockpuppets of a user named english patriot man i see that this man is nearly obsessed with polish people he seems to spread his antipolish propaganda by distorting the historical truth concerning world war ii nazism in europe and racism against poles he is totally denying the sufferings of the polish nation thank you so much for taking care of him and taking care of the articles that are his main targets however now he might create another sock and log in from some other computer or place so that his personal data and ip address would be totally different this is why i suggest us to patrol the articles that are his main targets like racism in poland racial policy of nazi germany war crimes in occupied poland during world war ii nazi crimes against the polish nation invasion of poland collaboration with the axis powers during world war ii nazism and race untermensch master race white supremacy racial hygiene nuremberg laws aryan race aryanization aryan paragraph name nationalism holocaust victims racialsegregation nazi germany persecution of black people in nazi germany occupation of poland polish decrees kidnapping of children by nazi germany forced labour under german rule during world war ii extermination through labor antipolish sentiment antislavic sentiment polish question polish joke ahnenpass anschluss lebensraum rassenschande adolf hitler nazism racism scientific racism themes in nazi propaganda germanisation reverse racism relations between nazi germany and the arab world glossary of nazi germany this guy is using multiple sockpuppet accounts to delete all the information about poles being percieved as subhumans or nonaryans by the nazis in fact the only aryanlooking poles that were accepted by nazi germany at the time were kidnapped as children and underwent germanisation they were like of the whole nation the rest of the poles were insufficient to be a part of the naziruled nation and were treated only slightly better that the jews this guy he spreads lies all across wikipedia therefore i thank you for your quick and effective actions name if youd need any kind of help in restoring the data which english patriot man destroyed just tell me i will also try to patrol the articles about poles,0

this is a potentially ridiculous article seriously it is a potentially ridiculous article and mislead readers to comprehend the word x86 for the following reasons should sort amd64 or intel64 implementations as x86 generally x86 was used to point all the processors compatible with ia isa might or might name themselves with such as cyrix 5x86 intel pentium and so on amd64s long mode is devised by amd rather than intel so how can one sort them together nowadays software labeled themselves as x86 are ia compatible software and use x64 or x86 differentiating with it so this article confuses reader getting in touch with this word generations what is the 8th generation x86 processor who invented this kinda processors amd k8 just says that it succeeds amd k7 rather than saying it is the 8th x86 processor and ive never heard intel call their x86 processors exceeding the 7th generation and one thing should never be denied the first generation of itanium processor says its family model number as which might potentially imply that itanium might be the 7th x86 processor succeeding name but none confirmed this so take turn back the transmetas crusoe and name if the morph firmed on the system board implements x86 decoder call themselves as x86 processors then if put the same processor on another board implementing powerpc decoder then it would be the powerpc processor at this situation what kind of processor is it ridiculous whats more for what sort it as the 7th8th generation x86 who is another name making up another northanger abbey x86 is one architectureisa name what such a ridiculous thing that ive ever heard on earth x86 is used to referring the processor a kind or series of processors rather than an architecture if it were the name of an architecture then in this logic way intel is one of the implementation of this architecture,0

hey it is my judgement in the matter of name that you wikipedia editors do not like to actually receive criticism but you do like to dish it out in a nasty and abusive manner you have to change this attitude on your part your attitude is that everyone has to agree with the consensus even if it is demonstrably wrong in my experience name is absolutely right in what he says you guys are of course wrong you prevent correction of your obviously wrong errors by blocking this legitimate criticism that is why your efforts are worthless and wikipedia is just not usable as a source except to cite misinformation on a topic that is being disseminated every day i find dumb stupid or just plain false statements on wikipedia i think it should be banned as it is not accurate in any way that i can determine your blocking policy seems to be the source of the continued errors in wikipedia i dont reccomend any one using it for any reason it is just plain innacurate,0

automatic protection for main page it would be straightforward to write a bot that protected all images on the main page adding templatemprotected and unprotected all images with templatemprotected that no longer appeared on the main page feature would be genuinely useful and save editors work however if editors came to rely on feature then that would introduce a risk because there would always be a gap between an image appearing on the main page and the bot protecting it a clever vandal could vandalize the image in that gap and worse the bot would end up protecting the vandalized version of the image i suppose the bot could attempt to detect vandalism like that but you can see how complex the process could become may utc,0
my twopennorth is that it is probably better to say name in terms of south africa but in rhodesia one should prefer the term european and african this doesnt imply that the governments were directed by europe merely that they were composed of people who were descended from european settlers this was the accepted term used at the time rhodesia did not have an name system it was at times suggested but ruled out as impractical name aym,0

ive read your reply to vartans talkpage i dont think there need be any more evidences that ankaram laciner and falcon are all the same user the one disapear and one reapear just after is just more than a coincidences that each add links to his journal is more than just coincidences that each have contributions covered in his journal is just more than coincidences that falcon has the same prejudicial beliefs as laciner is also not a coincidences at all if you are attempting to show us that there is nothing surprising that three different users contribute in the same articles where nearly no one else has contributed and that they all registered just after the other has left than i think it is failed probabilisticly when adding all the elements there can be no rational doubt that they are all the same person quebec science is also something i read which is more notable but it doesnt have any entry in wikipedia neither has its president or what have you his page and im sure he does give lectures around the world too ix,0

there are plenty of video game articles that need assistance in some form what the admins are looking for is proof that you want to contribute constructively to the encyclopedia ranting about a block and not finding one article out of millions that needs some form of constructive editing isnt very helpful to your cause if what you say regarding the squid is true then heres what id suggest identify the episode number of the show that contained that information televisions programs can be considered reliable sources if the show is factual in nature such as a documentary or news program take that section of the squid article which admittedly is rather short and expand upon it just as the admins suggested note the number of brains with the source information locate other articles on the web showing how the intelligence of the squid has been tested and add that write that section here in your talk page making sure to use proper grammar spelling etc au93,0

this post placed here september grazon who does not sign hisher postings on wikipedia i dont understand what you mean political beliefs are you implying that i am taking the opposite side of this argument because name is a republican ergo i feel the need to protect him im sticking up for the man because i have looked at primary resources and know what they say and what they do not contain which is any inkling of name involvement what i cant figure out is why is it so important for you include name in the name that you would base you whole argument on what one book claims,0

yes i agree wladimir is going to have to many fights to headline now name has considered fighting name after name defends his cruiserweight title and he has also expressed rematching name he wants to fight name but name wants to much money to make it happen clearly hes trying to cash out that might be it for his career since other p4p boxers have more sections i dont see the issue with adding more for name but we can decide that in the future after his next fight for now there is only the name fight given the slap in the prefight conference spitting in wladimirs face before the fight and brawling with name in the postconference i think this is worthy of a headline its also one of the most defining fights of names career as he won it at an old age with only one arm,0

april utc you are only now presenting sources for some of the information which you have inserted in your last revision of the article you did not cite the sentence about fundamentalism once again the statement about public schools and id materials was unsourced when you first added it which is why i removed it upon further examination i removed the statement again because the article never explictly stated that the centre for intelligent design was responsible for the distribution of these intelligent design materials to public schools it is actually very unlikely that this centre for intelligent design did so in light of the fact that the government proclamation was issued in and this organization arose in finally believing in the historicity of adam and eve does not make one a fundamentalist many christians reconcile the genesis creation narrative with science see the biologos foundation for example which advocates evolutionary creation the entire roman catholic church billion people teaches the historicity of adam and eve and that does not make them young earth creationists or fundamentalists i have filed a case on this dispute here and encourage your participation in it i hope this helps thanks talk,0

i see that this debate has in any case been preempted by username who has created and populated the categoryconstituent countries of the united kingdom in my opinion this is unacceptable as the debate is still in progress indeed it has barely begun and the new category name has the rejected term constituent countries and is therefore contrary to a decision reached after a long discussion and contradicts the main articles name countries of the united kingdom and the term found in most other relevant articles personally i dont see why name should not be categoried as european countries i am certainly against this unilateral reversion to a contentious and rarely used term that has been rejected here this new category is not acceptable and a consensus decision would also be needed for the proper and logical alternative ie countries of the united kingdom if the need for it is proven and accepted,0

narciso name please refrain from making edits to subjects you clearly know very little about name collaborated with name not name to invent his guitar name an anamerentice of name later formed his own shop and name subsequently played a name string as for your comment about names hands this is simply ignorant as to the true reasons why name invented his guitar as well as the technique of playing it which was not to use open basses to simplify technique as some nitwits think including string guitarists and clueless former students of name i have the autograph manuscripts to prove that more often than not he used fretted basses rather than open ones even when the open ones were available depending on what best served the music do you have these proofs no so please stick to what you actually know fyi name had extended techniques that enabled him to fret the first strings d together with the low g on the 6th string by using the left hand thumb again we have the proof of this it was even published in one of his old scarlatti editions preceding unsigned comment added by your discussion at narciso name first you added information that was not correct except for the reason you gave for names death and it is not constructive to to add biased unneutral opinions like name was the most notorious second it is a wellestablished fact that ramirez and name invented his tenstring guitar as i said name was an anamerentice at the name shop then but the first nametype tenstring guitar was a ramirez guitar moreover name had the idea to construct a guitarra damor with multiple string resonators inside the body of the guitar this was rejected by both name and name as impractical it was name who solved the theoretical and technical problems by adding only strings tuned a very specific way c a g f alongside the normal strings you want a verifiable source here name iii name the tenstring guitar in things about the guitar name name isbn phone third i clearly said name fretted bass notes even when the same bass notes were available as open strings f or g are very often played fretted rather than open i have this in his own handwriting and own fingering yet you will presume to know better and call this fact worthless because it disproves your ignorant unconstructive remark about name short hands being a reason for playing a string guitar furthermore name frequently uses the 7th fretted because it is the lowest string but not frequently the 8th as you mistakenly claim which is a minor 7th higher than the 7th string moreover these strings can be used to voice chords as originally written in the urtexts by nonguitarist composers like ponce or rodrigo that are impossible on the string except in the edited versions being able to use open strings as crutches for a lack of technique was certainly not part of names entirely musical reasons for inventing his guitar though i will add many tenstring guitarists today who are secondrate guitariats in general have adopted the instrument to make up for weak techniques this has nothing to do with names own performance practice on his instrument as someone who has studied for over a decade with one of names leading longterm students as someone who has thoroughly researched all aspects of the string guitar as someone who has access to many many unpublished manuscripts and annotations i can safely say that i know what i am talking about name even frets a2 and g2 on the 10th string rather than play them on the open a2 and g2 strings and in an example i have in his own handwriting and the reasons for doing so are in the context entirely musical and not about any technical limitations which exist only in your imagination you know nothing,0

trimming sounds fine but where a dispute comes up i would recommend slowing things down focus on one or two specific quotes and if someone reverts instead of immediately reverting back try to come up with a compromise version ditto with the other person reverting instead of immediately pushing the article back to your own preferred version try to come up with a compromise with each person changing each others work rather than reverting it will probably be much easier to try and come up with a consensus version also use clear calm and neutral edit summaries referring strictly to the article and not the editors in terms of refactoring what i was referring to was cases where a particular editor was being referred to when a post is phrased such as you did this wrong or he is unwilling or hes just always stubborn then thats getting away from discussing the article content and is veering off into discussing the editors name is to try and phrase talkpage posts without referring to editors good habits to develop though they can take time to get the hang of it are to avoid the words you and your also avoid naming specific editors in a post as that often has the immediate result of making someone defensive and then they may miss everything else thats said instead when it is necessary to refer to a specific thing that was done diff the edit without mentioning the editor like i disagree with this edit diff as i feel its a violation of policyguideline a better way to handle things would be suggestion i know it may sound a bit confusing to do this but i have seen that using this kind of thirdparty discussion technique can work wonders in deescalating disputes it also tends to make whoever is using the technique sound extraordinarily calm and thoughtful even if offwiki they may be hopping mad it also has the added benefit of making things much easier for administrators to take action when an uninvolved admin comes to a page in dispute and they see everyone yelling at each other the admin normally assumes that everyone is a bit in the wrong the admin wont care who started it theyll just address things as they see them in that moment but if an admin comes to a page and sees five editors discussing things calmly and one editor being uncivil then it makes it much easier to figure out how to reduce the disruption name just because one editor is being uncivil doesnt necessarily mean that theyre in the wrong but if the discussion has degraded to the point where all theyre doing is namecalling rather than actually discussing the article then thats a problem that an administrator can easily address by removing the nonconstructive editors from the discussion onka,0

hi i just wanted to comment on the organization of this stub i think it would be easier to read if you separated some of the bigger paragraphs into smaller paragraphs also none of the information under applications is cited if this section wasnt written by you and you havent found any evidence to support these statements then it might be necessary to rewrite this section under references reference list is misspelled also it would probably be best to integrate all sources under one reference section if you could incorporate more images to this topic that would also be helpful to see a visual representation relating the hologram to the holonomic brain theory the analogies in the hologram and holonomy under theory overview was very helpful to understand the concept,0

unfortunately judging from previous warnings some people here have a rather unusual view of what personal attacks are pointing out that the individuals accusing me of using sockpuppets were incorrect and in fact the two main people making the accusations have been harassing me for months and had used sockpuppets and meat puppets themselves for getting around edit conflicts and to stack votes on a request for name proceding as pointed out by several editors at the time certainly cannot be considered a personal attack pointing out that admins did not have any actual policy basis to make the blocks is not a personal attack and it has in fact been confirmed by the overruling of the blocks more than once frankly if you are looking for personal attacks try yourself for your agfviolating attacks on my actions based upon limited information and actually misleading information given to you by other individuals or name for claiming that i am trolling when all i am doing is defending myself from false accusations of others its very clear that a number of people here need to realize that the very things they are accusing me of and trying to justify for a block are exactly what they themselves are doing from behind the pretense of trying to solve things if you want to start blocking for incivility i might suggest removing name for a while for his actions or name for falsely claiming that i was using sockpuppets or that i was harassing her or the sysop whose very talk page says hes going to go around blocking people no questions asked and in fact did so after i caught him restoring placing illegal information on how to pirate software an article talk page rules should apply to everyone and a number of people have been getting away with pretty flagrant violations and trying to rationalize them away by just labeling me as an alleged problem editor and not taking any sort of responsibility for their own actions,0
wow i dont think you get it its like the boy who cried wolf false accusation after false accusation if only you picked at least one rule and stuck with it but the more things you make up the more it appears you are twisting to suit yourself curiously i posted about your escalating warnings for an edit that has remain reverted and the ani board informs you are not even an administrator again wpcivil and post no further threats on my talk page that is also harassment and a personal attack,0
pseudonymous editing copied from an email received offline hi im not quite sure how this works but your wrote in my deletion review you say that your name and address are available but your contributions to wikipedia are pseudonymous does this mean i hadnt registered i did so last night and not under a pseudonym as most people have i always use my real name in signatures and i dont know how to post to your talk page because there appears to be no post link thanks name email email thanks for your message but i think perhaps my meaning was still unclear whether you register or not doesnt really matter since anyone can register under any name i could go online and register a wikipedia account as name at least if its not already taken wikipedia has no means to authenticate your identity independently all that we know all that we can know is what you choose to claim about yourself thats what i meant by pseudonymously any registration even if you say that its your real name is technically a pseudonym it is not independently verified against some external identity database and for the most part that works out very well on wikipedia we want users and editors to establish themselves through their actions and to demonstrate their expertise through their edits not by making claims to outside credentials by the way anyone could also register as name that trivial misspelling would be easily overlooked by readers but would still be accepted by the system such a person could sign their name the same way you do attempt to mimic your pattern of speech well writing really and make subtle edits just to discredit you that in fact is a real problem for established editors of wikipedia when we find usernames that are suspiciously similar to established users we look very carefully for signs of vandalism or deceit users who appear to have done something like that on purpose are generally banned from wikipedia but those are all manual checks there is no system that can automatically detect or prevent it likewise no one can inherently trust the email address the way internet domains are set up anyone could register bathoryorg and create any email name they wanted like wikipedia accounts emails and internet domains are unverified against any external identity authority and thats before you consider the problems of email spoofing and forgery both of which are far easier and common today than any of us would like to admit most people are honest but there are enough dishonest people out there that we have to build our systems and our procedures in such a way that it doesnt matter whether they are telling the truth about their identity or not thats why wikipedia has a policy against original research which we mean as a contribution or assertion based on personal experience and why we never rely solely on selfpublished materials and why we bias our policy so strongly in favor of reliable sources such as websites owned by and operated by large wellknown organizations organizations with both a vested interest in and the resources to find and stop spoofing sorry to bore you with all this but my nonwikipedia profession is information security the inherent problems of identity management and authentication occupy much of my waking hours how can a bank know that youre really you and how far can that trust be extended under what conditions can an assertion be treated as reliable how do we balance that against the need to make systems and computers easy and accessible unfortunately there are no easy answers short of establishing a national identity database something which would be in great tension with my role as a privacy advocate anyway ill get off my soapbox now thanks for your message to post to my talk page just go to the page and edit it like you would edit any page on wikipedia the most common technique is to use the little plus sign next to the edit this page tab at the top that will automatically create a new section and give you a line to create a section header without having to know the wikimarkup symbols you should also get in the habit of signing your posts on talk pages you can do that easily by ending your comment with four tildes when you save the page the mediawiki software will replace the tildes with your username and the datetimestamp again welcome to wikipedia talk,0

agreed although it means bloating the alternative title by yet another word i was concentrating on the polish attitude here as it clearly provides the starting point for the article at hand obviously if the article is to be written from a supranational perspective at least the czech experience needs to be included czechoslovakia being the only functioning democracy in the region by the 1930s had closer ties with the west than poland did and was betrayed in a much more obvious and tangible way than poland was the west politically accepted the countrys territorial mutilation which was not the case with poland that said i am not sure if the inclusion of countries such as finland the baltics yugoslavia or even ukraine which had never been independent in the first place is a good idea while the west could have arguably done more to assist any of these societies before and after the war i think that the articles focus should be on poland and czechoslovakia in order not do dilute the whole issue after all there were dissidents in germany and the soviet union too who were harbouring grudges towards western politicians because of their appeasement policy oct utc,0

do you follow the current scientific literature please try not to sound so ridiculous when you are accusing others it has a bad reflection on your own comments nevertheless recent research indicates that selfdescribed race is a nearperfect indicator of an individuals genetic profile at least in the united states using genetic markers name et al identified genetic clusters among individuals sampled from locations in the united states and were able to correctly assign individuals to groups that correspond with their selfdescribed race white african american east asian or hispanic for all but individuals an error rate of they conclude that ancient ancestry which correlates tightly with selfdescribed race and not current residence is the major determinant of genetic structure in the us population,0

i had a look at the sahabiyyeen list on arabic wikipedia there are articles about many more individuals but most of those are very poorly sourced but if we go through them properly i think it will be possible to at least get enough information about notability and minimal biography but the problem is that my arabic is very very poor all i can understand on reading nearly properly is the namean i tried google translate as well but the quality seems to be very poor but i will try my best to do what i can to improve those articles i used to work basically on astronomyrelated articles on name i think this can be my major field of work here i agree with your view that we need more accessible information about all these individuals but i am not sure whether wikiipedia would be the right place for that perhaps as you said an extension and thanks for all your time i can understand that you are a busy person but you have been very kind to me and have spent a lot of time discussing with me i hope i will be able to deal with my cowikipedians in such a manner and i will try my best to take your advice and improve these articles and their sourcing perhaps it will help improve my arabic as well thanks again and best wishes,0

you are correct about the word but wrong about lyotchik in russia civil pilots a called pil t and military pilots are called ly tchik it is a military profession not a rank same as pilot not a rank in any military word sold t means soldier and used same way as in english word mory k in russian comes from word mory meaning sea so in general speech it coul be translated as a seaman even some online translaters do that or as a sailor but in military ranks important is the equevalency not the translation and the equivalent to us rank of seeman would be russian rank of matros while moryak is general term which could applied to anybody who seves in navy or in a civil fleet,0

i already know the map from name but this far away from being an evidence that the suryoyesuraye called themselves assyrians or considered the ancient assyrians as their ancestors the deutschen dont call themselves germans germanen or alemanes alemannen in their native tongue and its not the first time that the word suryoyesuraye was mistranslated into assyrian by outsidersmissionaries and colonists do you have quotes or chronicles from nestorian christians before the 19th century and in their own words which shows an ethnic assyrian continuity the syriacorthodox church has quotes and chronicles which goes hundreds of years back where they equate name with oromoyo in their own words interestingly the arameans from maalula who are either name or muslims call their aramaic languagedialect also siryon or loghtha siryanoythaaramoytha which is a result of greekchristian influence on the arameans the word name which literally simply means syrian in english is rather a religious term similar to maronites catholics or melkites nevertheless words can change their meanings in course of history even if the word name derives from assyrian ot doesnt change the fact that the arameans where also known by this name,0

color coldplay exp rt lets talk this talk page is for discussing the article not world war ii history in general summary of consequences i believe that in an article one must state the consequences of historical events and in a summary article one must summarize the consequences my edit stating that as a result of the francobritish action on czechoslovakia the molotovribbentrop pact was signed is a factual statement this is not names arguments this is not a soviet apologist stance this is a direct and undeniable consequence of said event in the spanish civil war the red army fought side by side with the name lincoln brigade prior to the francobritish assisted nazi sudetenland grab relations between nazi germany and soviet union were icy when the nazis were declaring war on czechoslovakia the ussr was hard at work putting together an antinazi coalition only after seeing the british and french backed down in the face of naked antislavic aggression did the soviets begin to look for other allies there is no mass conspiracy here as the search began right after the event this is not a motive its a statement of facts if there are no more objections i will reinsert the statement into the article as it is merely cause and effect respectfully disagree the statement as a result of the francobritish action on czechoslovakia the molotovribbentrop pact was signed pretends to describe a casual linkage although in actuality the linkage was not so obvious and the scholars opinion on that vary dramatically one school thinks that the only and sincere soviet unions desire was to establish a collective security system and an antinames coalition another school believes that the only names aim was the alliance with name the third version the most reasonable in my opinion is that the ussr was almost equally suspicious and hostile towards most european powers that was at least partially justified and considered all possibilities to avoid a direct war against germany with other major powers playing a role of neutral observers and to expand its territory the statement you tried to introduce into the article is a pov of the leftist part of the first group scholars we cannot present it here as a sole interpretation of the events we have either to tell a full story that is impossible because of space limitations or to abstain from any interpretationsinterestingly your statement may be even simply incorrect because according to my sources names occupation of czechoslovakia lead to rapprochement between the ussr uk and france and could lead to signing of antiname triple alliance in only a month after occupation of czechoslovakia these three powers started consultations that lead to full scale political and military talks had name and name have a little bit less prejudice against each other and had ribbentrop been little bit less active wwii could be preventedre this is not a motive its a statement of facts no all these facts had already been in the article before your edits your wording looks like a description of motives not statement of factsif you still disagree try to propose another wording that takes into account all what i wrote in addition a consensus exists among those who edit this article that all significant changes are being discussed on the talk page before they are introduced into the article try to follow this unwritten rule that saves a lot of time and efforts as there are multiple different interpretations of most key events of world war ii and wikipedias guidelines require that all nonfringe views be given equal weight it isnt feasible for this highlevel article to discuss casual links between events what nick said also the ussr wanting to be neutral argument falls apart because historical evidence clearly shows that had france honored its alliance with czechoslovakia ussr would have intervened as well ussr secured a passage from romania in order to assist czechoslovakia ussr placed all of its divisions west of the urals on high alert after the seizure of czechoslovakia the ussr held the uk partially responsible and frankly did not trust them or the french as allies if france failed to uphold their defensive treaty with czechoslovakia why would a defensive treaty with ussr,0

roazir fars is the arabic version of pars the iranian name when translated to english is the gulf of pars and the english name persian gulf means exactly the same thing interestingly enough most name in the world are called like the iranian name for eg gulf of mexico gulf of aden gulf of carpentaria gulf of the farallones gulf of maine gulf of tonkin gulf of guinea etc etc so the correct name for the persian gulf should have been the gulf of pars just as the iranian name is as for the azarbaijan as both versions already exist on the name and we are not inventing a new name i insist on using the one that is recognised by the majority of the people in the region the whole population of name is less than of the population of iran let alone other countries in the region who write and pronounce the word azarbaijan like iranians do so why a vast majority should follow a small minority it is azarbaijan and english speaking people better get used to it,0
apparently other editors agree that the edits i made were justified a group of meatpuppets working as a team to revert an article to their own pov is what has caused this block at issue was the advert tag which is justified was placed on the article by one editor replaced by me replaced again by another editor and replaced again by me three editors so far have indicated the tag belongs there im sure a forth editor is going to weigh in on this side too the article is riddled with brochure language please note that i was removing brochure language right up to the lockup of the article theres still lots more in there that needs to come out before the advert tag should be removed additionally i dont believe i broke the 3rr rule which requires a fourth reversion,0

some wikipedia editors have proposed that wikipedia article content should be in proportion to article count in other words if there are articles about suburban express about history competitive battles etc and articles blog posts mostly about the recent newsy trash that of the article should relate to the recent newsy trash one big problem with that is the fact that many of the blog articles are simply regurgitated from one seminal article or two in other words if there are blog articles there may be that are essentially copied from the initial two if the body count method of assigning weight is accepted duplicateregurgitated articles should probably be ignored,0

ahh yes by name in this instance i do mean members of the church of jesus christ of latterday saints i can see how youd read that section in this way perhaps we can clarify what do you suggest it is not that the doctrines changed but rather that what name emphasized changed what is and what is not church doctrine is a fuzzy thing and as you likely know has always been the case many things that church members believe to be doctrine is not but cultural doctrines promulgated by church members in any case the teachings of name and what he emphasized are fuzzy enough that many people thought his earlier teachings were more accurate or that he changed doctrines or that the current church misunderstood his teachings on many matters we have to balance this to be historically accurate with what is believed and taught today not an easy task im open to suggestions in how to change wording lets discus here and then make the changes suggestions also id invite you to join wikipedia we always need newcomers registration is easy,0

explanation dear edjohnston and bearian i am not here to harm any one or to put any unnecessary information in wikipedia pages here in ust global wikipedia page i update the latest information regarding ust gloabal so that wikipedia users get the right information under right category under corporate milestones company achievements needs to be listed the link may have the recent major information about ust global but the top part of the page that mentions about key executives is totally wrong two people and their postions who are not part of ust global is being mentioned here ust global is a company where in past there may have a lot of people who were part of this company in key rolesposts during their asscociation with the company their names may have been part of this company related records but once they left this company searching for other oppurtunities i dont understand why they want to mention their name associated with ust global this is like self advertisement which is totally against wikipedia policy please advice me if i am wrong in my understanding thank you namem,0

december utc i am new to wikipedia but feel like i am doing good and really enjoy it here i made my first edits ever over at commons regarding this issue and was i believe questioned about being new i admitt i lost my cool and told my accuser to shuve it but is this how actually new editors are treated there i doubt i will spend much time there going forward thanks for letting me vent,0
i think name that your suggested reference to name s involvement in the img is too long and that something along the lines of brief flirtation would be better i think that the img reference needs to be shortsomewhere in the early career sectionposted after the article has been expanded a little otherwise the article might appear weighty i think the last point is important as it seemed to be a consensus reached by a number of wikipedia editors after much wrangling and gnashing of teeth but bedsides this brief dalliance with marxism in an overall consideration of his political career pales into insignificance compared to his being controversially thrust as a third choice candidate into the position of defence secretary at a time of crisis for the british army in terms of the number of casualties being sustained and a lack of resources this is simply not reflected at all in the name article i tried reflecting it as follows his appointment formed part of a chaotic cabinet reshuffle by the prime minister who considered at least three other candidates before appointing name but this was dismissed as speculative opinion by off2riorob above even though from my point of view it is easily the most significant event in name s biography perhaps we can reach a consensus that if a better reference can be found which i suspect should not be difficult that it can be reincluded i want to stress that this is again not meant to be an ad hominem slight against name but merely drawing attention to the fact that his appointment was the equivalent of throwing someone in at the deep end and indeed he has had a very difficult time of it since his appointment actually it reflects worse on name and the farcical reshuffle,0
i disagree the fact that it used to be single party government is largely an irrelvance the important thing is that it is still a constitutional monarchy parliamentary system that allows for both coalitions and majority rule that hasnt changed and so to say that because we currently have a coalition of whatever party means that the position of deputy prime minister should be included alongside the heads of state and government is false i am all for mentioning name as deputy prime minister in the article around the same place name is currently described as prime minister but to put name alongside the name and prime minister on the basis of it being a coalition government is not right now if the job were constitutionally defined as being the prime ministers secondincommand and if name were to dieresign suddenly name would become prime minister i would completely agree that he should be there but it isnt name may be deputy prime minister but he is not deputy head of government and so he should not be put alongside the head of state and head of government,0

edit request on may i would like to change the snake article because in the section titled perception in the vibration sensitivity part i would like to add in that snakes have a special little bone the skull connected to the lower jaw and quadrate bone this bone detects and transmits vibrations collected by the lower jaw bone touching the ground which is then transferred to the quadrate bone to be analyzed by the snakes inner ear this function picks up lowfrequency sounds and vibrations and this is my reason to add to this article my source was from my book titled snake by name i hope to inform other viewers and also hope to expand in my studies of herpetology please except my request alyssa mirizzi,0

you reverted me and gave a reason when i called it external links i reverted you and gave a reason again i dont see the dispute now if you read verifiability self published sources are reliable published sources at the other end of the reliability scale lie personal websites weblogs blogs bulletin boards and name posts which are not acceptable as sources rare exceptions may be when a wellknown professional person or acknowledged expert in a relevant field has set up a personal website using his or her real name even then we should proceed with caution because the information has been selfpublished which means it has not been subject to any independent form of factchecking so if the person who wrote this can be found to be an acknowledged expert in a relevent feild then it can be a reference if he has not then it can not simple,0

i would be glad to noformation a conflict of interest is defined as where advancing outside interests is more important to an editor than advancing the aims of wikipedia the aims of wikipedia is to produce a neutral reliably sourced encyclopedia my position is that editors from the rationalskeptic wikiproject and their ilk are not neutral in this subject and in fact are incapable of being neutral because they do not have any hands on empirical experience with acupuncture no specialist dedicated learning in it have not taken the time to grapple with the unique and complex paradigm that contextualizes it and thus their knowledge of it is incomplete and immature and they are illequiped to provide a full rounded mature and neutral synthesis of the information available on this topic now as for myself i will tell it straight i work hours per week in acupuncture practice earning per hour acupuncture practice is not my main source of income in fact my only purpose for practicing acupuncture is to deepen my understanding of the art and sharpen my skills in it it requires hours of purposeful practice to become a master of any discipline and one day i aim to achieve mastery in this discipline i refute the suggestion that those people who are most qualified have the most experience have done the most study and are most knowledgeable and passionate about this subject should be excluded from editing on the grounds of coi in fact these are the ones whose input is most valuable far more valuable than the input of ivorytower rational skeptics who only bother to attempt to understand acupuncture through a theoretical critical and dismissive point of view in fact considering the tone of most editors on the acupuncture talk page which emulates the tone of those quackwatch websites that proliferate on the web these days and considering their devoted following of name and their elevation of his work as the number source on the page literally and their transparent agenda of debunking the pseudoscience they consider acupuncture to be it rather seems to an objective observer that is those editors who are advancing outside interests rather than being neutral and thus they in breach of coi as opposed to i,0

before you start throwing accusations and warnings at me lets review the edit itselfmaking ad hominem attacks isnt going to strengthen your argument it will merely make it look like you are abusing your power as an admin now the edit itself is relevantthis is probably the single most talked about event int he news as of late his absence is notable since he is the only living expresident who did not attend thats certainly more notable than his dedicating an aircracft carrier i intend to revert this edit in hopes of attracting the attention of an admin that is willing to look at the issue itself and not throw accusations around quite so liberally perhaps if you achieve a level of civility where you can do this we can have a rational discussion on the topic and resolve the matter peacefully,0
not at all you are making a straw man argument here i never claimed name had that position rather that practitioners and researchers in the field ignored the dsm position which is exactly what the quote says and also something name agrees with again i was combating the notion that it was a absurd part to claim that pedophilia is a sexual orientation since many researchers hold this position it would be unfair to call it absurd the disorder part is divided in the field some argue that it is not a disorder at all some do at the end of the day it is a value judgment as cantor pointed out earlier in the thread not a scientific judgement if we choose to make this value judgment in the article it should be stated clearly and not pretend to have a scientific basis,0

the very long discussion over st wpscn project talk page i have read a lot of the wpscn pages and the very few have neutrality tags some have or tags but the majority seem to be npov so why is the project talk page being bloated by a discussion between three scientologists from what i can make out have scanned all three user pages and a lot of comments are unsigned about how the project is biased against elron would the time not be better used by going through the pages and challenging npov possibly by throwing in neutrality tags and pointing out nonnpov statements on the talk pages of those articles after all name is fa status so the npov cannot be too far off as for unsigned the comment you left after my first post was unsigned and there were a couple of more during the discussion,0

well have a look at this photo especially what the grabber is doing with his hands its very plausible and highly likely that there were scratches i use grabber guardedly since a person who by force of arms takes and carries away is a robber at least here under the common law so a more accurate description would be attempted robber as for your argument about idiocy thats like saying rape victims are at fault by wearing skimpy dresses whats wrong is wrong is wrong and using violence against an innocent civilian to promote a political agenda is wrong and you cannot justify it by the tenuously connected actions of another talk,0

well lets try again one more time re commonsenual wpor regardless of sui generis it has all the characteristics of belligerent occupation name commonsensual is not or occupation sensu stricto is something quite concrete and it is regulated by various international conventions for instance guggenheim lists three different forms of occupation and one of them refers to something quite unique therefore we can speak about the occupation sensu stricto and occupation following an armistice that is what i mean under commonsensual occupation and that is how a reader will understand it re belligerent occupation i do not deny the fact that some sources do describe it in this way however other sources majority of sources use different terminology therefore the reference to one more source that uses the terminology you like does not change a picture much i propose to present both viewpoints you reject the very opportunity that a second viewpoint exists therefore it is your arguments that do not hold water re malksoo please reread his works again and since both you and i can draw different conclusions from different pieces of malksoos text below is a quote from his own explanation of his own position made specifically for us the baltic sattes were occupied in june and annexed incorporated by the ussr in august thus both occupation and annexation did happen the fact of annexation and that the ussr proceeded with its policies from the presumption that these territories were its own not occupied changed the nature of the occupation if not in terms of law than at least in terms of political realities for example when moscow olympic games took place the olympic regatta took place in tallinn this cannot be a typical occupation situationhowever it is important that the article would make clear that in the eyes of the predominant western opinion and post restored baltic states themselves the soviet annexation remained illegal in this sense illegal annexation equals extended occupation and the whole debate is a pseudodebate the annexation since it remained illegal did not create any extra rights to the annexing power the ussr if the article makes that aspect clear i would be perfectly fine with the title of the article being changed to occupation and annexation of the baltic states in fact i would recommend such change because it takes more precisely closer to the facts into account the complex nature of the soviet rule in the baltic states what else do you need malksoo clearly says that in the case of the baltic states both occupation and annexation took place and we can speak about continued occupation in this sense but not in others ps llegal annexation equals extended occupation in other words we can speak about occupation in a context of the state continuity of the baltic states and i never argued against that again what synthesis you accuse me in re there is no bridge between the baltic and sovietofficial russian positions there is no inbetween or continuum of scholarship its one or the other wrong there is a baltic position position of different foreign states which was different from state to state and from time to time positions of scholars western baltic russian soviet positions different during 1950s70s and during perestroika and official russian position re from name to malksoo a belligerent occupation name is an authoritative expert in the military aspects of the wwii not in the legal aspects malskoo does not consider soviet intervention in as a military operation at all the only aggressive step according to him was a naval blockade re baltic citizens became a lower class as their homelands were colonized probably however other sources tell that the real economic and political situation in these republics were much better than in other parts of the ussr hence extensive influx of migrants was it possible if they had a colonial status i expect you to treat my arguments seriously,0

first off you should not edit the list templates directly as the bot will ignore any changes also you cannot use vertical pipes anywhere in the syntax other than in separating the template name the section name and the reason otherwise everything messes up in place use from the yellow box at the top of my talk page if ive left you a message on your talk page i will watch it for your response so please reply there i am aware that the name usually overwrites manual edits as i said i spent hours trying to figure out why following the instructions listed on the rfc page werent producing the results they should have but when i saw that you had manually edited the list templates i thought perhaps you had disabled the name until it was working properly basically youre telling me the syntax that is commonly used throughout wikipedia vertical piping is not valid within the rfc templates thats messed up whats even more messed up is the total lack of user instructions that mention that restriction this has become a nightmare of a process,0

the bands legacy names banquet etc an anonymous user is repeatedly misreading the guardian source and insisting on adding a dubious tag to it heres the direct quote the spark for fairport taking this watershed turn was the bands album music from big pink the record that along with name and the bands name bootleg brought about a widespread musical volteface in which what remained of psychedelia was replaced by a new rootsiness among the rock aristocracy its influence was evident in the name illfated backtobasics project let it be the rolling stones purple patch that began with names banquet and name decision to call time on cream the anonymous user takes issue with this statement claiming that music from big pink could not have influenced names banquet because of chronology ie that the stones were almost done recording the album when big pink came out but read the statement it does not say that it influenced the recording of banquet but the purple patch that began with etc this seems clear to me i would like to hear some other editors opinions on this matter thefortyfive,0

im not sure from that comment how much you understand about research in this area there is for example a dispute about the validity of selfreported results in the general evidence base for cbt which has gained momentum in the last five years a lot of new work has been done since that would throw those claims into dispute at the moment you are giving prominence to a one country study in a controversial area that is itself years old that is cherry picking as the table gives a false impression of cbts position in the pantheon of methods i can understand an advocate pushing it but we have to be balanced here talk,0
given that you dont provide any actual content but seem to spend all your time formatting articles and reverting people i suppose i oughtnt expect you to understand that the vast majority of content on wikipedia starts off unsourced wikipedia moves forward by sourcing unsourced material not by removing it it certainly doesnt move forward by removing trivially verifiable information like my nigercongo languages edit that you reverted in which i merely added a statement that most of the languages of central southern and eastern africa are bantu i apologize for the vulgar edit summary in my revert i was irritated i stand by the contention made there that it was a total wppoint violation,0
it seems to be one of the old info from the times when in wikipedia the need for sourcing them was not so pressing simply remaining unquestioned until now i dont know any external source that would present how the roma have significant cultural similarities with the cultural features that the balinese borrowed from the subcontinent because of this and because it may be misleading lacking the presentation of the common cultural features with the indians personally i have in mind to add them when ill have available time i consider it would be appropriate to delete this statement,0

response to rsuser comments i often make interim edits that are clearly out of anger and then quickly revise them means nothing it doesnt matter how we feel about each other it is the expression that counts i appreciate very much that you gave your higher and better self the final say in your comments i agree that it doesnt matter and only raised the item because i noticed how very angry and upset i had made you for this i degree of turbulence i apologize very sincerely and i hope you will forgive me we shouldnt deprecate views just because they come from insiders i agree and fortunately if i were to unconsciously break this rule im sure someone will call me on it,0

i actually hadnt even seen the current equalization filter article when i spoke before but now see that its content needs to be merged into the future article equalization audio that you both have proposed i could make the issue a little more complicated though graphic equalizer not yet written name face curve parametric equalization and british eq all have to do with what ill call music equalization for lack of a better term this includes sections and of the current equalization filter along with possible future articles tone controls loudness control combine with name face speaker equalization etc oh im certainly not saying that these need to be separate articles but could as well be topics in one article except that a few of these already exist separately the article should mention that equalization is a misnomer but has become the accepted term since these are typically used to modify the tone to suit someones taste not strictly to compensate for a channels frequency response then there should be an article which discusses actual channel equalization or some such term which would include section of equalization filter telecommunications lines riaa equalization fm predeemphasis as well as equalization of nonaudio channels this is the orginal meaning of equalization such equalizers are generally nonadjustable by a user at least and transparent to the end user so i call it a different subject even when it is audio anyway i dont have much time to deal with this nor am i the best person to write about the specialized issues regarding either professional audio or channel equalization problems though id be very happy to review what is written and check for errors and missing issues come to think of it i dont have to ask for permission,0
resentment in france the perceived preference of the british navy for evacuating british forces at the expense of the french led to some bitter resentment are you sure about that the article states the bbc said they have waited until the very last man so it means everyone was rescued the french article states the french resentment vis vis the bef came from names refusal to launch a traditional counterattack as planned by french commander general weygand name wanted an evac as he claimed it was inevitable in the mediumterm the british chief of staff supported name and the british operation was launched instead of the french plan,0

doherty epilogue why does the section mainstream scholarly reception end in a comment by doherty himself decidedly not a part of that mainstream which basically says that someone else should come along isnt this akin to a proponent of a minority view saying that one day oh happy day the majority will come to see the wisdom of the minority view and change its mind revision and changing minds are an essential part of all branches of scholarship but why should we give a platform to any one view in this smile back well i do see your point but i think theres arguably validity in assigning a special preference to the view of the subjects of the article of which doherty is a notable example and the only one im aware that has commented on the subject,0

fair enough but the snark was not appropriate also in his edit summary the admin only focused on the reliability of the source and his snarky edit summary seems to imply that the leaving in the name comment was ok if a rs was provided so the admin seemed to have a handle on the obvious notability of names comment and in any situation snark was not needed,0

so the link was a personnal attack how funny and i thought it was a good critic on your contribution on this page here without the external link just for you only me who is arguing you have been blocking anybody who does not agree with you on this issue shameful and now you want to find a way to make her less portuguese than canadian what a joke stating that she is no more canadian than she is portuguese is misleading she was born in canada and she lives in canada where are your sources for such a brilliant comment you should apply for an award for the silliest entry on wikipedia but come on lets get real here this not an acceptable comment from an administrator who also erased information with reliable sources just to get his own way now you decide there are different degrees of nationality being the canadian the top one pathetic and you say it is personal attack if i consider that you have a xenophobic view on this issue because you underestimating one nationality to emphasize the other your own your neutrality on this issue is something inexistent content must be written from a neutral point of view npov representing fairly and without bias all significant views that have been published by reliable sources this is nonnegotiable and expected on all articles and of all article editors the other two are wikipediaverifiability and wikipediano original research you not only erased reliable sources that say she is portuguesecanadian you also have no sources whatsoever to claim she is more canadian than portuguese if such a thing ever exists other than in your mind show the sources if you can prove it is not your own original theory the current version clearly states that she holds both nationalities what a lie citizenship is not the same as nationality and even nationality could have a different meaning depending of context and if what you claim was true you would not be erasing all the time that she is portuguesecanadian,0

dear wikinews wikipedia since conflict of interest neutral is an important subject since conflict of interest is being herald by wikinews wikipedia staff and volunteers including being used by wikipediawikinews administrators and editors with which to have an article story be deleted and is grounds for action against a contributor then please immediately provide documentation that editors administrators and people providing articles and information to wikipedia and wikinews have no conflict of interest to the articles and stories they create edit supervise andor contribute for example did any editor have sexual relationship with a porn star or purchase movies or magazines of a porn star whose bio is listed on wikipedia this is a conflict of interest another example does any administrator editor or volunteer of wikinews and wikipedia including blackpearl14 svtcobra name and whoville own disney stock have gone to any disney theme park watch disney movies andor buy disney products then blackpearl14 svtcobra and whoville and all of these editors and administrators are in conflict of interest does the people involved with the wikinews articles about fossilized fish found in canada or with scientific discoveries or with lawsuits have any connection to these products places or businesses then this is a conflict of interest what kind of verification did wikinews and wikipedia use to determine that volunteers including blackpearl14 svtcobra and whoville don t sell disney products and have no business with the walt disney company and their affiliates as documented volunteers including blackpearl14 svtcobra and whoville together claim conflict of interest and delete any contribution in regards to pirates of the caribbean for either wikinews or wikipedia and control it by upholding double standards thus first we must verify wikinews wikipedia enforcement of their policy of conflict of interest and neutral wikipedia and wikinews editors dont follow wikinews own written polices do you know of an issue that has been forgotten then you generate and justify reason after reason to state that the above article is not newsworthy and that wiki does not write old news you even say one thing and then later change that to be different claims to justify deletion you keep throwing different claims at an article you have targeted because someone had shown the charges to be untrue wikinews and wikipedia continues to uphold double standards and then make statements with which to justify it incredible you ignore any details provided to your counter your claims and then accuse the person of not acknowledging your control and your new set of claims are you aware that wikinews editors and wikipedia are in conflict of interest as well they proven that they have a network of supporting friends using double standards without following wikinews and wikipedias own written polices and such wikinews and wikipedia allows editors fans to be bias controlling whatever they choose to write even placing things like porn stars penis size copies of that have been documented as well and to write articles that are one sided promotional and links to various sites that further promote their cause yet the editors delete anything that is added that they don t approve from other people and then justify reason after reason such as claiming other people as being a conflict of interest not being neutral and such if they write or contribute its against wikinews and wikipedia policies to simple delete when in doubt dont delete and not to show respect when communicating yet you simply deleted the entire talk and all related pages and justify various statements calling it whatever you want to get your friends to sign off on your control if you don t abide by wikinews and wikipedia s own written policies then remove all of the polices and stop tell the public to follow standards which are double standards and more does the owner of the company know you are doing stuff like this,0

vandalism on btheory of time it seems perhaps i have been going about this the wrong way so i will try to be helpful and explain why your last edit was vandalism first off the description intro the quality of the intro had been greatly increased name as the founder is just repeating was is in the origin section hence there is no need for it the description gave a better just of what bthoery of time is a whole undoing this completely is therefore vandalism especially if you dony first talk about it in the talk page before editing secondly you removed description you then deleted the description as in metaphysics changed the better updated version of the physics part then moved it in the origin section there really is nothing i can say about this i have no idea what kind of twisted reasoning could be behind that move thirdly you removed this section it is noted by name in presentism and the spacetime manifold that atheory is almost certainly a minority view among philosophers while btheory has achieved broad acceptance it seems you perhaps have a personal agenda favouring atheory therefore editing in favour of it this is not allowed on wikipedia and it is vital to keep a neutral point of view the above statement however is correct and cannot be removed simply because you do not want people to see it finally and on the most relevant side you name information it is an improvement that you have put the name talk in an oppose section as opposed to to the description section however a lot of it is not quoted rather you have stated the opposition as out right fact such as the btheory suffers the same incoherence as all theories that time is illusory namely that an illusion or appearance of becoming involves becoming so that becoming cannot be mere illusion or appearance the buddhist can consistently deny the reality of the physical world since the illusion of physicality does not entail physicality but this is not the case with temporal becoming you stated this outright this is an opinion of names it should be demonstrated as such i also do not believe it belongs on the page and it is an obvious dig at another religion in fact you have stated all of names opinions as fact if you want to make edits please first discuss them in the talk page and we can talk about whether it is relevant or not and how it should be worded docheuh,0

damn damn im a vandal and youre reverted like of my edits in like seconds i might have to retire lol,1
i apologize for cursing you out i lost my temper and it was unacceptable im completely deserved a block although i think you had no right to give it to me that said looking at the last few pages of your contributions nearly all your edit summaries are mosed reverted unexplained and unsourced changes tidied copyedit or similar im sure i was overstating the case because i was angry but this does seem to be your main activity in the main space on wikipedia not that theres anything wrong with that its good to have people who copyedit and so forth but i think my basic claim was more or less true and i dont misunderstand the way wikipedia works ive been here for four years and ive never run into anyone demanding sources for utterly uncontroversial statements the way that you are if we are obsessive about this kind of thing wikipedia will never grow and it is completely counterproductive to revert unsourced statements of what is essentially common knowledge and i think my understanding of this is a lot closer to the way wikipedia actually works than yours is which is based on a completely nonexistent perfect world idea of what wikipedia should be,0
for what its worth i suggest you refrain from pushing the socks remarks around as it only seems to add fuel to the matter given that an spi has been opened and name denied due to stale accounts and behaviour evidence alone it serves no purpose to accuse him further just as it serves no purpose for him to accuse you of stalking no one is going to win that type of argument also i suggest you stop calling cowboy jake from now on as it also implies that he is someone he claims not to be clearly he is determined to push his case and the only way to make it go away is that you ignore him altogether socks are a complex issue as they come in different forms but if you give them enough rope theyll eventually hang themselves with it challenging suspected socks nonstop is sometimes considered uncivil and may seem like a personal attack without confirmation spi does not support the claim at present and baiting cowboy will not look good on your behalf whatever the outcome im sure by rotating ip he probably means proxies it isnt important though cheers chat rff,0

borgqueen how is it that you are going to delete the entire wikipedia regarding cuisine of hawaii and then disable me from the wikipedia whithout any comment do you feel its your personal responsibility to run around the wikipedia and deleting all the information and turning everything into convenient sentence paragraphs maybe you could try petitioning wikipedia to create wikisummaries for those people who cant be bothered by the burden of reading or gaining encylopedic knowledge maybe you could be the creator of your own little site entitled ecyclopedia summaries and your motto could be everything you need to know or ever wanted to know in short easy to read sentences without cumbersome vocabulary best of luck with that cuisine of hawaii will be restored for hawaiians by hawaiians your racism and predjudice has no use in an international enclyclopedia but maybe in star trek the cuisine of hawaii is just push of a button or a hologram is that it could you explain it more detail for the world to read please borgqueen live long and prosper,0

proposed move to stiffness to weight ratio why is this article named with the least commonly used term for this property google returns results for specific modulus results for specific stiffness and results for stiffness to weight ratio i could understand this if wikipedia were advocating the term specific modulus eg because it is shorter or more technical sounding or whatever however my understanding was that wikipedia was explicitly not in the advocacy business and that its articles should be named with the commonest term in this case the commonest term occurs ten times as often as the other two terms this name has the further benefit of being selfexplanatory whereas those unfamiliar with either of the other two names would have to consult a dictionary when they encounter it in a text which may well be why it is by far the commonest term i therefore propose moving this article to stiffness to weight ratio and linking the other two terms to it this wont compromise findability in any way but the choice of name will indicate the most commonly used term,0

starblind and hyperindividualist com are part of the hoax a geneologist expert has been brought in to verify the previous article several of the points have already been proven with verifiable facts and evidence yet when those point are made evidently clear both starbling and email continue to ignore it and chose not to respond the true hoax on this name family page is that these two individuals are trying to ignore verifiable evidence and have set out to destroy good knowledge for everyone verifiable knowledge starblind has decided to put what ever he wants on the page but can not provide a single source of evidence to validate his selection these two hoaxers have only one desire but to detroy good validated information for the public and to extend turmoil these two hoaxers continually make attempts to stop progress and provide no real solutions for wikipedia problems i suggest that starblind be removed from wikipedia editing he is a trouble maker of the highest category and ignores reason,0

one addition mustafaa i promised much more stuff but have been too busy lately one thing that sticks out and could be fixed quickly is the beginning of the invasion yes it is my fault for adding only the argov incident which now makes it sounds as if it was the main reason for invasion which is of course wrong so the sentence on israel invaded lebanon in response to the attempted assassination of israeli ambassador name by name in london on june should be expanded this is a quickie list of basic facts israel had been bombing lebanonplo for months from the air sea and land and preparing for the invasion see below they couldnt have pulled of the invasion in a matter of days otherwise there was the attempted assassination name the assassination attempt was used by name as an impetus to shortcut the knessets debate and move into lebanon without full approval israel invaded with troops ill post links and add more explanations if needed dec utc,0

what vandalism name you have two btw what vandalism communicatorkills patriots script logo can anyone upload the patriots script logo the duck super bowl loss the recent super bowl loss is a highly significant event in the history of the patriots franchise the opening section discusses the dynasty status of the patriots but hardly mentions the effect of the recent loss this page has featured status for fair and proper discussion of important patriots facts however the page now feels unbalanced and biased due to its brief and perfunctory coverage of this highly significant loss it is beginning to feel like a protected fan page as opposed to a balanced and factual discussion of important facts relating to the patriots obviously the page should be protected from vandalism by giants fans but this page needs to acknowledge that the patriots lost a game that many football experts are calling one of the greatest upsets of all time dlomme yup communicatorkills taunting disguised as factual information looking through the history of edits since the super bowl a lot of information thats being added and much of it since deleted may be true but the inclusion of it into the article seems more like a subtle attempt at taunting is it really relevant that the patriots are the first team not to win the super bowl who cares and believe me im no patriots fan theyve been a thorn in my teams side since last seasons playoffs but this is supposed to be an encyclopedia entry not a fan forum this page should be locked from any further edits for awhile unless something truly relevant to the patriots should suddenly occur actually protection is not something to be taken lightly being an admin and even though i am a diehard name fan myself the level of problematic edits to this article while high is not so bad that we havent been able to keep up with it by rollbacks and undos talkcontribs far ive nominated the article for featured article review since a lot of the content that was there when it was nominated has now been moved elsewhere protection this article is starting to get vandilized again if it were up to me i would make it temporarly semiprotected i wonder why vandilism is returning to it get over it people the superbowls over so you want me to request semiprotection communicatorkills name the franchise history section seems to be a little biased against the patriots whenever a superbowl loss is mentioned the opposing team and score are given when it gets to the part about the patriots winning name not only are the teamsscores not given but it doesnt even say that they won them ie under belichick the team went to three super bowls in four years it should be consistant one way or the other the sentence the patriots however were defeated by the new york giants in super bowl xlii after winning the first games of their season is very clumsily tacked on to the first section i think it warrants another sentence or or at least the deletion of the word howev,0

ringmail i dont know if he regards himself as an expert ive sweated enough to know for sure that a broigne is not a victorian mistake and to find citable sources for it i understand that the english language world lacks proper history on the subject but from a continental point of view theres no mistake possible that ringmail is different from chainmail and was used in the period between the fall of rome and the comeback of chainmail in the late 1100s also the high handed way in which he remade all the article with no regard for the effots of those who came before him and without even setting up an account for people to discuss the matter with him wxas to my view qualification for vandalism im quite willing to include the bit about representations making it difficult to differenciate between chainmail and ringmail and the possibility of misconceptions in the 1800s but the basic matter as established with my collaboration stands even if it has to be edited further,0

hello name and welcome to wikipedia thank you for your contributions i notice that one of the first articles you edited appears to be dealing with a topic with which you may have a conflict of interest in other words you may find it difficult to write about that topic in a neutral and objective way because you are work for or represent the subject of that article your recent contributions may have already been reverted for this very reason to reduce the chances of deletion you might like to draft your article before submission then ask me or any other editor to proofread it to start creating a draft article just click your user name at the top of the screen when you are logged in and edit that page as you would any other if the page you created has already been deleted from wikipedia but you want to save the content from it to use for that draft dont hesitate to ask anyone from this list and they will copy it to your user page the one firm rule we do have in connection with conflicts of interest is that accounts used by more than one person will unfortunately be blocked from editing it is also worth noting that wikipedia generally does not allow editors to have usernames which specifically link them to one company or corporation if your username does have such a name it would be advisable for you to request a change of username if you are stuck and looking for help please come to the new contributors help page where experienced wikipedians can answer any queries you have you can also just type on your user page and someone will show up shortly to answer your questions here are a few other good links for newcomers the five pillars of wikipedia how to edit a page help pages tutorial how to write a great article manual of style i hope you enjoy editing here and being a wikipedian please sign your name on talk pages using four tildes this will automatically produce your name and the date if you have any questions check out wikipediawhere to ask a question or ask me on my talk page again welcome,0

that is interesting about batman i think it gets away with it because it was promoted in before the major fu crackdown the issue with fair use vs free images i see is that if there was the possibility of finding free images then we wouldnt be able to use any fair use images they would be deemed replacable what kind of free images were you thinking of the only thing i could think of is if we could find a free image of the panel at comiccon showing the castcrew that seems like a good addition to the article im certainly open to any other ideas dust8212,0

this needs an additional citation for the first part only refers to him now being labelled a cheat name has never been a fair footballer the match has just brought to light the foul play he has always used to get an upper hand even the biased french and arsenal fans realise furthermore the quote by name that he is one of the fairest players i have managed holds no weight since it is a biased view from a man who managed name for years it is a view from a man who has managed a great number of cheating players during many years at arsenal so saying name is one of the fairest isnt saying much in summary i think that the line should be changed to the incident brought to light the true extent of names bad sportsmanship name,0

the removed paragraph name is often rationalized as a response to forced magyarization which happened mainly after the ausgleich compromise of while no one now considers magyarization a positive trend for several reasons the rationalization of slovakization as a response to it is questionable magyarization happened during the times of the monarchy and it happened in a time period when human rights were not considered nearly as universal as now name is happening since then and it was as severe under communist dictatorship as it is now in democratic i have removed this paragraph not because i would necessarily disagree but because this is a speculative formulation a pov in wikipedia terminology not suitable for an encyclopaedia if this was an undisputed topic maybe such formulations could work but since that is not the case it is definitely better to stick to pure sourced data,0

this entry was deleted by its author owing to the fact that it contains research which is being distorted somewhat since its a part of an ongoing research piece by a working journalist ive decided that any distorition to the research could be problematic thus the simplest thing to do in order to avoid antagonizations distortions etc is to remove it since you have decided to continue this antagonization i am left with no alternative but to report you to those in a place of authority at wikipedia of course you may feel free to complete and post your own research on the havana shipyards however ive decided the best course of action is to register the copyright on all pertinent research statements and images associated with this article use of any of the above by persons other than the author without his permission is in violation of international copyright standards and will be promplty reported to the fcc federal communications commission and all other pertinent authorities,0

name firstly i appreciate you taking the time to discuss this issue offline and for your willingness to debate it at length here despite the majority view here being in your favour yes i certainly agree with your friend that it is very important to describe the jurisidictions that a firm is present in there is clearly a massive diffence between say having offices in the french or japanese jurisdictions or between the chinese and us jurisdictions since the legal and regulatory systems are very different as well as the commercial characteristics of the markets beyond that however it remains my firm view that there is a big difference between a law firm having an office in say paris or name even though they are both in the same jurisdiction i appreciate that the situation in the us is slightly more complex since you have both federal and state jurisdictions even within each state there will be big differences between the legal markets in different cities though to give an example the san jose market will be not just a lot smaller overall than the los angeles market but it will also have a quite different profile on the whole a lot more specialist niche and focused on high tech to give another example in the uk a law firm could never be regarded as being truly top tier if it didnt have an office in london even if it had offices in every other big city in fact all of the very top tier uk firms dla piper is not yet regarded as one of them despite its size have just one uk office in london although they have other offices overseas saying that dla has has offices across the united states egypt south africa kenya thailand china would in my view still mean a loss of valuable information to the reader we could fall back on using descriptions like in major financial centres or in major commercial centres or in a combination of major financial centres and major commercial centres but then we are introducing what is in my view an unnecesssary element of vagueness imprecision and even original research i do accept that dla with offices is right on the borderline of having too many offices to make it practical to list all of them in the article however i do also feel that there is an important general point of principal that information about the office locations of a law firm is very valuable information to aid the reader of an article in understanding the subject of it and should be included as much as possible,0

you left me a note a couple days ago about whether i thought abp burk would be named a cardinal i dont really know but i doubt it st louis is one of those diocese baltimore is the other that comes to mind that sometimes has a cardinal but not always we have not had one as abp since name retired in the early s he died in about i think as the church becomes less a european and north american church we will see fewer cardinals from small and midsized diocese like stl and more from africa asia and south america i also think the controversies over things like st stans make it less likely thatburke would get picked for a red hat,0

this poll while doubtless entertaining to bbc audience in england and perhaps of some interest is not a conventional poll and certainly no reputable polling organization would offer such results as a scientific measure of pubic sentiment further its presented as if it reflects a historical trend in public opinion as if according to a scientific measurement scotts popularity had declined over a period of time however there are no comparable measures from previous years presented presumably because there arent any had the bbc conducted a similar callin program in etc perhaps scott would have been more popular in earlier years i bet in earlier years he would have ranked much higher than name et alia than during early century broadcast poll am i at least partly stating a semiplausible case for why this may be nonuseful information,0

yes i understood that as such i do believe that he ought to be included in that class of americans but as you point out no such category has been created for that to occur i added that to name categories actually realizing that after i had made the addition however i kept in the article because i was hoping that someone would simply add the category however after you reverted my edit i relented based on your reasoning which is why i specifically added the category name to the article because it was an existing category instead you have reverted that edit entirely defeating the action which i had taken which was to broaden the murder of name into not just a racial consequence but a human consequence as well it is the same with name while each of these people were civil rights leaders who were assassinated they were also human activists attempting to make the world a better place who were murdered as such i was trying to include name and name along with people like name name name name in a broader specter of significant humans that were assassinated however you removed that edit i give up,0
i did not say that i am saying that you deny that the people who retaliated were lebanese even theough they carried lebanese flags to be consitent and not racist i would like you to deny that the people at the beach were australian even though they carried austrlaian flags it is just representive of your racist flexible logic and reason were you can apply principles inconsistently in a racist fashion without noting the contradictions please stick to the facts i never condoned acts of violence on this thread i merely hold your racist onesided contradicitons to account,0
if the nazis meant name as empire they could have made that clear by translating it that way in englishlanguage material they produced they did not do so they always used name in english translations for one of many examples see this page it is the official german government translation of a name speech note that name is always name the nazis did not consider frederick the great as having anything to do with the first name they did view him as a great german the problem is that your case depends on what appears to you to be a very accurate translation wikipedia does not depend on what editors think it depends on what they can support with reliable sources you have yet to provide a single reliable source that supports your point i and others have provided quite a few supporting the opposite,0

after this case the child exploitation and online protection centre ceop attempted a nationwide assessment of child grooming the report found that police social services and charities were failing to properly investigate this hidden issue and that a quarter of offenders reported for child grooming since were asian an apparently disproportionate figure but name the head of ceop was quick to clarify that the findings did not provide a national picture because of incomplete data and cautioned against extrapolating anything from the results he added that looking at this issue through the lens of ethnicity does not do the victims any favours again im not sure that this section needs to exist also from the outset it is misleading ceop constantly monitor for and act upon child grooming they didnt suddenly decide to start after this case ceop has existed since april and there has been a phased introduction of their work in conjuration with partners ever since starting its main recognised operations in by which time the police were acting the wording implies that ceop had not acted earlier to protect the victims they could not act they did not exist ttfn,0

the organization of subtopics culture is thrown way down towards the end after economy and tourism which is inappropriate the information section is unnecessarily loaded with history and detailed geography which makes it not only uninteresting but also repetitive information is interspersed all through the subsections without regard to whether or not they fit there eg the geography section starts with the fact that up is the 5th largest state that is not strictly geography and belongs in the introduction climate belongs towards the latter part of the page perhaps before toursim regions and cities is not such an interesting combination in any case cities of uttar pradesh can be an interesting topic on its own because up has several interesting cities and regions each with specialities of its own like the copperware of moradabad ceramics of khurja and carpets of bhadohi in fact i remember there used to be such information in the article before,0

ongoing issue several editors have expressed concern at your edits to the spirit of st louis article reviewing the case i agree that the edit seriously skews the statement to a nonneutral point of view the difference between first and first solo is a very major one imho and cannot be allowed into the article asis alcock and name clearly make the first nonstop flight by removing the word solo you are creating a false statement in the article this is a serious problem i see several attempts to discuss the matter both here on your talk page and in the talkspiritofstlouis talk page but i have seen no responses from you to date this is another important wikipedia policy change is fine even radical change but if it results in controversy you should address the concerns simply put you have not done so i dont want to harsh out here but i do need to make sure the message is clear unless you have a good explaination and tell us what it is any further edits to reinclude this change will be treated as vandalism and result in a blocking of your editing privileges if you really feel that this change is minor and accurate then you need to address the concerns brought forth by the other editors first,0
name is in rough shape with the recent purge of content the page is not as informative as it once was the biggest problem is the first section which had the proposed benefits of basic income topic removed one editor may appear to hate naturalfinancenet since the reason for removal was declaring that site to be a blog also removed were affordability calculations that were researched and verified with working links but also published on a platform that can be declared to be a blog meanwhile the content left in the top section has poor references that do not appear to match the content for instance there is no reference for any conclusive argument or data that basic income creates a disincentive to work and the link to reciprocity is not online and the topic not a major issue both of those topics have good quality blog classifiable sources available in order to name i would recommend that eligible source material be broadened to include any quality content including from sources that are not government funded basic income is after all not within any traditional government agenda and so limiting information to sources funded by interests against basic income harms the quality of the article and prejudicessuppresses the article from being informative and enlightening barring this broadened content eligibility we all need guidance for what is eligible content and perhaps what makes naturalfinancenet ineligible the content there was written in and has been adopted whether independently or without attribution by other authors here is the major recent deletion specifically the proposed benefits section should be reproduced some of these can be sourced elsewhere but we need a clear understanding of why it was originally deleted proposed benefits naturalfinancenet describes several purported benefits of social dividends and basic income wealth redistribution is the best possible economic development program because the wealthy dont spend as great a portion of their income as the poor do basic income is the most efficient possible form of wealth redistribution because there is no bureaucratic overhead needed to filter recipients or find and punish abusers basic income as an alternative to public retirement pensions such as social security in the us is the only possible prevention of generational theft that will occur if the funding sustainability of future retiree pensions and care is threatened reduced crime as a result of lower levels of desperation balanced power in the labour market as a result of not needing work out of desperation and better competitive position of workers if some people choose not to work better work opportunities as a result of people better able to afford an education or business start up smaller government made possible and attractive by the alternative of increased basic income to offset any program cost reduction viewed this way the cost of every government program is paid for equally by each citizen even if the source of government revenue is progressive income taxation social justice is achieved efficiently and automatically with less requirement on charity and welfare it is easier for volunteer home owners to help the poor and secluded through group homes by being able to rely on their certain income its possible and easier for the disadvantaged to group up and help themselves in the same manner natural finances definition of social dividends variable basic income tax revenue surplus over social program expenses essentially allows the level of basic income paid to citizens to rise with economic productivity and automation growth the affordability of basic income adjusts automatically to the performance of the economy,0

okay but the tag is inappropriate because both articles lead off either in the title or the first few sentences of the article by noting that there are mosque controversies elsewhere than ground zero that means the reputable sources not wikipedia editors all on their lonesome are making the connections between these mosque controversies and the one about which this page is written the section is clearly not or and needs to stay,0
a tag has been placed on oneclickjobcom requesting that it be speedily deleted from wikipedia this has been done because the article seems to be about a person group of people band club company or web content but it does not indicate how or why the subject is notable that is why an article about that subject should be included in wikipedia under the criteria for speedy deletion articles that do not assert notability may be deleted at any time please see the guidelines for what is generally accepted as notable and if you can indicate why the subject of this article is notable you may contest the tagging to do this add on the top of the page and leave a note on the articles talk page explaining your position please do not remove the speedy deletion tag yourself but dont hesitate to add information to the article that would confirm its subjects notability under the guidelines for guidelines on specific types of articles you may want to check out our criteria for biographies for web sites for bands or for companies feel free to leave a note on my talk page if you have any questions about this,0

utc an interesting comment convict leasing isnt the same as slavery where theres ownership and title however i would agree that we could amend the lead to read effectively abolished slavery true there is a difference with chattel slavery and forced prison slave labour one ended w the 13th amendment and the other was legalised under the 13th amendment not the corwin amendment of in other words what would be the legal justification for the prison labour in california oregon and other states that practise this form of human rights abuse without the involuntary servitude clause wwhat do you think they were referring to futhermore i dont see a problem including this in the article so long as it is a small reference and not the focus of the article as to scholarship there is reputable work on this and there is no doubt that starting in the prison chain gangs were leased to private business plantations mines etc for being picked up for the most frivilous charges yes they were mostly black the mortality rate was higher than chattel slavery because they were leased and not owned virtual life sentences on absurd charges directed against black people w forced labour is slavery though not chattel this was systematic and went on until ww2 though todays version is slightly different now some of you asked for refrences and rightly so slavery by another name by name who is a respected writer journalist and received the pulitzer prize for this book which is on this very topic thats the point this is far from original research and there are other scholars whove written about it now i havent edited the article nor will i unless there is some agreement w others editors here but id like to know the issue as it is now how do other editors feel one other thing american historians do not always agree on things and i have noticed at least one conspicious neoconfederate argument in the article unsourced though on a different part of the article so yes its important to look at historians but on some topics theres a whole lot of rubbish particularly w slavery issues so a consensus by historians may never happen and sadly ideological agendas do exist and i understand what you blokes mean about good sources id say that keeping this article from vandalism is far more important july,0

great but what i meant about weakest link is that i dont see an explicit connection to developments in noise music in the sources ive seen have you got a source that places something called postindustrial in the context of the history of noise music im presuming this is the umbrella term invented by music journalists to cover any music that is stylistically informed by industrial music yet is at the same time far enough removed to warrant the post tag unless the sources are good on this its too divergent in my opinion to include right now some of what might be called postindustrial is not that far removed from pop music so it simply doesnt warrant inclusion you might as well do a section on deathmetal and its precursors but this kind of bifurcatory dot connecting is hardly the best way forward especially as the title of this article arose as a result of someone trying to define a single genre known as noise music personally i think it is perhaps a stretch too far to start covering any kind of music or any composerartist that might have dabbled in a bit of noise making and i dont think that is what should happen with this article unless the claims are sourced and thats why i mentioned already that we should try and stick as closely as possible to what the main sources dealing with the historical use of soundnoise in music have to offer we now see a number of artists for example name being redefined as a postindustrial musicians and the sentence throws in the year despite the fact that mills has been associated with techno for years now i find this kind of redefinition without strong sources problematic,0

edits by keraunos hi keraunos i see you added to and rearranged some of this article i ameliorated some of your additions for accuracy below are listed my ameliorations of your edits and my reasons for them you added the edit because the temperature of the cosmos rising toward infinity as the final singularity of the big crunch is approached will provide a potentially infinite amount of energy to power the cosmic supercomputer i take it that what you tried to explain here is the energy resource but actually that isnt physically accurate the universal heat diverging to infinity doesnt provide usable energy where the usable energy comes from is the gravitational shear ie the universes taublike collapses along different axes with each cycle called mixmaster oscillations which provides a temperature differential across the universe whereby usable energy can be obtained hence i went ahead and cut this edit of yours if people read further into the body of the article under the section outline of the physics of the omega point theory some of this is already explained with references provided for further research with a number of the references available online for free you added a bit into here the omega point represents the resurrection of the dead followed by an infiniteduration afterlife as an avatar in cyberspace which could take any imaginable form within the metaverse of the cosmic supercomputer due to its virtual nature i kept the ressurection link i understand from reading your user page that youre into science fiction and transhumanism but one should avoid loading up this article with needless science fiction terminology and transhumanist terminology as well as computer terminology which isnt that accurate such as avatar the term preceding your edits simulated reality already expresses the ideas youre getting at and people can follow that hyperlinked text if theyre not sure what that means you added most of this engulfed by artificially intelligent life as it approaches the point of maximum expansion which according to name will occur between x and x years from now in proper time one should be more accurate in their terminology as most people think of artificial intelligence ai as meaning intelligence via artifically created programs yet if uploaded human consciousnesses become a reality then the programs of their minds would be natural but on an artificial substrate hence im changing this to from that point on the entire visible universe would be engulfed by these mind children as it approaches the point of maximum expansion with mind children referring to the previously defined mention of the term i also removed your quote of names estimation as to when the universe will be engulfed as that is from his book the physics of immortality yet later cosmological observations have been able to define the hubble shift more accurately which is what that estimation is based on so names current estimation is different now for more on that see f j name the structure of the world from pure numbers reports on progress in physics vol no april pp see also here also released as feynmanweinberg quantum gravity and the extended standard model as a theory of everything arxiv april you added the section criticism from string theory i kept pretty much all of this while editing it slightly to improve the style and formatting i changed the section title to implications from string theory since name doesnt actually offer any criticism of or even refer to names omega point theory in names book that you referenced this section as it stands now might have to go entirely as it appears to fall under wikipedias rule concerning original research as its written its a valid deduction that the omega point singularity would be obviated if string theory disallows singularities and if string theory is true but its an original deduction you moved the see also section to underneath the references you also added a number of links therein based upon wikipedias featured articles it appears that the preferred location of the see also section is where it was previously before the references hence i moved it back i removed the link metaverse because its a science fiction term thats perfectly explainable with more acce,0

relevance in a new zealand tv2 series presented by name called sensing murder which aired on tvnz beginning in three psychic mediums from australia and new zealand name name and name armed only with photographs of the victims of unsolved murders and purportedly no prior knowledge of the cases attempted to help police detectives and a team of investigators by communicating with the spirits of the victims to uncover details of their life and death the team of investigators followed up the psychics leads and apparently came up with information about the killers and whereabouts of victims remains skepticism regarding the series has come from several sources and it was further satirized in the season finale where host name humorously highlighted the fact that not a single case had been solved just how relevant is this granted it does provide criticism yet it is from a television show we are given no knowledge of the reputation or fame of these mediums so it is difficult to criticise all based on a few if high profile mediums were used i would have been inclined to agree on the inclusion whilst the rest of the criticism section is valid and comes from scientists etc the validity of a statement by a television presenter is small and it is difficult to see any real reason for the inclusion other than to bolster the criticism section cheers,0

ok no reordering but can we give them designations like this im calling it list a so we can start a new list later without confusion if you dont like it well work something else out but we really need some way to refer to issues without saying hey getting back to that thing we were talking about the bit where it says that gage was traveling not the bit about the time when he blah blah blah one point we absolutely cannot refer to note x and ref and so on these designations shift around as the article is edited and we will go completely crazy in the below ive substituted permalinks instead issues list a name he may have gained skill with explosives on his familys farms or in nearby mines and quarries speculation from macmillan attribute it a1b gages date of birth in the infobox is not covered here when it should be covered and noted in proper context of its sourcing a2 gages accident a2a does not address numerous theories presented or gages actions prior to accident eeng knows all too well this subject i think name and name material needs to be pointed out because the evidence shows that gage had his mouth open and was speaking at the time the rod passed through his skull i do not know why this is absent i have issues with the section but ill hold off on the excessive quoting and measurement issues for now name life and travels a3a bt february he was able to do a little work abt ye horses barn feedg ye cattle c that as ye time for ploughing came he was able to do half a days work after that bore it well paraphrase a3b would gages mental impairment belong here i think it would be helpful a3c missing gages time in new hampshire prior to chile a3d chile and california is missing the account of gages doctor and missing some other tidbits not too bad but everything related to his mental improvement and the regaining of normalcy in his life is absent without reason a3e this is also the key section that macmillans research becomes quite useful as a case argument name and subsequent travels a4a still glaringly missing the details surrounding his return home illness and death a4b also the exhumation details which was in names book is entirely absent this little episode in the gage story is something which is important a5 other matters a5a analysis and actual examination of the claims and details surrounding gage and his role in science has been well mostly avoided by the article instead of proper detailing of the injury and gages role in history a5b only a few hundred words on gages mental impairments were written yet lengthy quotes are used a5c using passim and other issues in citing macmillan is also a copout and would merit a verifiability failure a5d not even that it doesnt even credit macmillan when it should a6 notes a6a a substantial part of the text is hidden away in these notes these complex rambling and citation filled messes that only make verification more tedious a6b a note like which reads see macmillan lena harlow bigelow harlow macmillan is just improper name macmillans book provides one of those rare occasions on which one can truly say that further research is not necessary the definitive account is just the type of note we do not need a3c for gages time in new hampshire didnt he spent months in a horse stable the article says gage subsequently worked for the owner of a livery and coach service in hanover new hampshire harlow says this began sometime in and he remained there without any interruption from ill health for nearly or quite a year and a half this fits with jmhs jhm name information that pg went to chile in august how about if we change it to for about eighteen months he worked for the owner of a livery and coach service in hanover new hampshire thoughts a4a missing details surrounding return home illness and death but he was in chile for about years correct then he returned and rested for awhile before becoming a farm laborer im not sure if this is on one or several farms but wasnt the convulsions following a days labor on the farm the seizures,0

so what if name and other file managers can be made to behave like dualpane file managers thats not their normal read preset mode of operation thats why they probably shouldnt fall into that category dualpane behaviour is part of names functionality not its whole functionality you can play textmode tetris from within name would you categorize name as a tetris clone as for your conveniently abridged definition of orthodox dualpane file managers are not traditional in any possible meaning of the word if theres any tradition in file management thats either the shell or spatial file management la classic name they certainly arent customary nowadays nor are they more generally accepted than other approaches so it actually sounds like youre making my point for me there besides the etymological read original definition of orthodox is having the right opinion which of course is crazy when applied to any kind of software but again youre missing the point as ive already told you the only criteria to keep into consideration is usage of the term in qualified circles,0
from my standpoint you are the confused im looking at it in the 3rd person what the alliances were in this ancient time is unclear fact is that the name were in an antiangles coalition and the angles came with their whole volk to defeat them if the name had contact to the former roman empire is unclear but possible they lived under roman rule for centuries and were romanized this defeat was something like deromanizing to them after years of roman rule this can clearly be seen when you read and understand the roman britainanglosaxon battles in germanic wars,0

such intransigent behaviour is not compatible with wikipedias policies of consensusbuilding and collaborative editing it only serves to incite edit wars anyway could you please explain why you consider the referece a strawman and unnecessary we are talking about name a wellknown socialist a household name and the epitome of intelligence also after reading my previous comment and the source are you still contending that socialism isnt opposed to individualism your substitute is not adequate either therefore it is asserted by some critics that socialistic is less individualistic firstly the use of a weasel words is strongly discouraged at wikipedia please read wpaww for more information secondly socialism is less individualistic than what this entry is quite ambiguous finally i have a reputable source to defend my edit whereas you do not overall your edit violates two wikipedia policies no orginal research and avoid weasel words,0

bluffview montessori school a tag has been placed on bluffview montessori school requesting that it be speedily deleted from wikipedia this has been done under the criteria for speedy deletion because the article seems to be blatant advertising which only promotes a company product group or service and which would need to be fundamentally rewritten in order to become an encyclopedia article please read the general criteria for speedy deletion particularly item as well as the guidelines on spam if you can indicate why the subject of this article is not blatant advertising you may contest the tagging to do this please add on the top of the page and leave a note on the articles talk page explaining your position please do not remove the speedy deletion tag yourself but dont hesitate to add information to the article that would help make it encyclopedic as well as adding any citations from reliable sources to ensure that the article will be verifiable feel free to leave a note on my talk page if you have any questions about this talk review,0
hello timtrent i recently found that you declined the article submission for namemogas group with the reason this submission is not adequately supported by reliable sources you also added that the links to the organisations website should be minimised i have been able to remove some information and references that had been obtained from the companys website however i am required to leave some references to the company website because i fear that the information would be deemed as g12 i was hoping that you could take a quick look at the article and advise me on any additional changes necessary for the article to be accepted thank you,0

i think the possibility of a corrupt core of admins is a problem worth asking candidates on so if anybody else posted this exact question there wouldnt be a problem with it particularly i imagine if it were a well respected admin with an impeccable record positing it i read each of the candidates statements and used that to judge if this question would be useful look at the time between asking the candidates questions also look at the ignore all evidence question this occurred to me as i was going along and it must be regarded as a general behavioural question when linked to the days question plus this shows it was not a spam question to all candidates i did pay attention to their statements this is the question i posed to select candidates what general concerns do you think are raised by the days of silence from the communitys admins in this ani are there any other general concerns which arise from the ani do these quotes ameliorate add to or amplify concerns do you agree with the substance of the name quotes if an essay wpignore all the evidence were written what concerns would be behind it and what could be done about them if you can point me to another ani where lies and deceit by two admins within an ani were ignored by the other admins in attendance for somewhere close to days then i will ask exactly the same question of those select candidates substituting this with that example would that be acceptable have you seen such examples of systemic corruption before or is this the only one of course to answer that you would also have to answer can you say in all honesty that you think name did not lie in this ani if you choose not to answer is it because you believe it is the moral thing to do or because of possible intimidation or repercussions on your good self,0

first if you create obviously bogus claims nobody needs to waste his time refuting the claim as applied to each excerpt you cut and paste one refutation is more than sufficient second your rationales appear to be shifting originally you claimed that the article contained creative facts and pov statements now you claim that a particular statement is unverifiable be very specific about what you find problematic citing the specific wikipedia policy given your contentious history with this article dating back over a year it is evident that your goal is to portray the exile as an uncredible source i believe you will reject any claims that undermine this premise regardless of their consistency with wikipedia policy consequently if you want to be taken seriously you need act cooperatively to resolve issues this means being specific in your complaints citing the exact policy this means no specious claims and this means accepting the article as undisputed if you dont have any specific issues can you abide by these conditions,0

colorado balloon incident greetings i reverted your addition of a news photograph of the colorado balloon incident balloon unfortunately wikipedias use is exactly like the commercial use for commercial news photography as the template you used states use of historic images from press agencies must only be used in a transformative nature when the image itself is the subject of commentary rather than the event it depicts its intended for images which are themselves iconic works of art so that we can use the images to primarily facilitate discussion of the image even ignoring the legal problems with using the news photography wikipedia has a hard requirement for freely licensed images because nonfree media compromises the freely licensed status of wikipedia refer to the first rule at wpnfcc nonfree images are not to be used unless obtaining a freely licensed could not be reasonably believed to be possible there were undoubtedly thousands of photographs of this balloon taken by amateurs and professionals alike almost any would do for the purposes of the article wikinews claims that the balloon was lowflying and that photographs were captured by area residents the best way to get an image for the article would be to leave a placeholder in the article requesting that the public submit one the effectiveness of such a place holder will probably diminish over time as the attention on this incident dies down ive been checking flickr and other photo sites but have so far come up dry though sometimes it takes a little while for people to bother uploading their photographs i hope i havent given the impression that i do not appropriate your contributions to the article as i do especially your efforts to use even and neutral language in the face of a media environment eager to describe the parties unfavourably thanks for your contributions,0

legally there are no rules which state any geographical or political requirements which a state has to meet in order to join the name area there are such criteria for joining the eu but this is a different matter the only possibility to join the name zone would be to enter into a treaty with the eu which includes a clause that namerelated eu law would be applicable in the associated noneu state the associated state would only have the right to be consulted thus the us would have to accept each and every majority decision taken in brussels whether citizens of this or that country would need a visa for entry into the area or not and the us would have to accept that every thirdcountry national holding a residence title of a name state could enter the us without even being checked to bil guadeloupe and french name are not inside the name area because this would eg require france to equip the complete rain forest border between french name and suriname name etc with hightech infrared sensors which would detect every monkey which is crossing the border just in order to avoid id checks on flights between there and europe i can understand why they do not invest any money into this,0

jab we met while visiting the jab we met article i was very much impressed at your good work however ive one small grudge that i raised on the articles talk page as well this refers to the excessive number of nonfree fairuse images in the article as per the nonfree guidelines the usage of excessive images is to be reduced and to be limited as much as possible most of these images carry name and kareenas images and hence images is far too high i was hoping to discuss this with you before removing them from the article page also i hope that you dont mind me doing quick checks for mos consistency and additional info,0

yes lets berate the new editor with no experience and no idea by then relegating their arguments to a version of wpown nice to have a comment that violates own and civil in one fell swoop while also stating theyre on a path to nowhere hence showing every reference to consensus was a sham because despite your claims of arguing with me being pointless you have admitted to have no interest at all to bringing the article in lines with wikipedia standards because hey its your article talk,0
good move plus the obvious does not need to be stated,0
unsurprisingly trimming it down to only gaffes afforded their own page leaves very few the article is much better served by discussing the topic and mentioning cases in context as they show up rather than having a section that is based on what an editor may have an opinion is a particularly memorable one especially since there are a few hundred gaffes reported every single month as far as i can tell lets chat,0
no consensus is the only argument you have user aprock has been involved in an identical dispute several months ago where he was removing the same source for no reason the drn favoured against him then and now he is trying to do it again user maunus has not provided any argument against my addition check again artifexmahem has not done so either did you even read the discussion,0

upittit block hi orangemike hope you are doing well and i appreciate your work here on wikipedia i have some questions regarding the block of upittit although i too have some concerns with this account which primarily are the lack of this editors responsiveness to numerous warnings of copyright concerns as name had pointed out and editors lack of engagement in dialogue regarding these issues this could be simple misunderstanding of the copyright policy for the editors user space but the repeated violations are disconcerting in fact i cant be entirely sure that the user account is only one person a kind of reverse sockpuppetry that makes me uneasy however it is my understanding that editors are not in wpcoi solely due to their place of employment or username but rather because of the issues of pov reliability and neutrality of their contributions however in this case my particular my concern is the work the editor had done in his or her own sandbox the now deleted issues this had not been demonstrated because all of hisher work as far as i know had been confined hishers user sandbox the editor was an obvious newbie and had twice sought feedback see here and here and had been responsive to suggestions demonstrated by the removal of pervasive external links downsizing of the article rewriting so it was not in violation of wpnotdir and the addition of outside neutral thirdparty references in fact although i did not see any of the editors additions to this particular article since july 7th in my opinion it contained useful information was notable and was ready to be moved from the user space into wikipedia proper mostly i would request that this page be restored as i would like to create that particular article myself and will not be able to duplicate the offline references from various library science journals that had been inserted i guess you could say that i primarily lament the loss of this particular article i would appreciate your thoughts on this issue and your review of the dscribe digital publishing article circa the july 7th version as i would like to see if there is anything salvageable from that sans the copyright violations that name elucidated thank you,0

npov dispute just so this isnt lost by the two suspiciously tangential talk page sections added just above this one here is a minor sample of the current npov dispute over this article in my interpretation the early october version of this article was rewritten with a load of weasle words which downplay criticm of the phrases usage and subtly play up the dubious narrative genre more mention of the possibility that the narrative genre is disinformation is needed the article should be explicitly clear that labeling an allegation a conspiracy theory is an attempt at dubiousness through association with the narrative genre also generally and commonly considered in the intro are incomplete and need to be fixed for npov the new version of the article seems to be saying a lot less than the old version we should go through the diff line by line did someone ever justify those massive changes though some of them were good t,0

for your information sir feminism is merely the belief that women are equal to men youve just stated that he does not care about the sex or race of individuals he obviously disagrees with many feminists on certain issues particularly abortion but he believes men and women are equal and thus is a feminist this article misquotes name and makes it sound like he believes unattractive women should not have access to mainstream society if you do not think he is a sexist than why should this portion not be corrected,0
signatures you have been warned previously and i am here to do the same please stop removing signatures from talk pages without comments being identified it is very difficult to follow a conversationdiscussion continued efforts to remove signatures will result in administrative involvement i encourage you to become a productive editor here at wikipedia but further disruption can lead to your account being blocked from editing talk copied from user talkauburnpilot there are others with unsigned edits and i dont see others adding to theirs the preceding unsigned comment was added by talk contribs december utc pointing to bad behavior by other people in order to justify your own is not exactly the best argument sign your comments or people will place the template next to them removing these templates is disruptive and inappropriate all you have to do is type tildes to sign a comment talk because of your continued disruption i have requested an administrator review your actions please stop removing from unsigned comments it also may do you well to read wikipedias policy on no personal attacks this comment is not helpful talk blocked again for problem editing look you have to understand how we do things here its alright to make mistakes and its alright to be a beginner perfection is not required but removing signature and namecalling is not acceptable here i have blocked you for hours for problem editing it mightve been hours but this is not the first time we dont have many rules here but were very serious about a few things one of them is cooperate with other editors youre just being intentionally uncooperative and combative here and thats not acceptable talk,0

defence of peacful schools of thought against wahhabi jihad continues quote from name raddulmukhtar about the first wahhabi wave the state of the followers of name was like this they rose from nejd and attacked our holy cities mecca and medina in hejaz they killed everyone who did not confirm to name then allah send the armies of muslims to push them back to nejd rest assured it seems until oil runs dry in saudi arabia the second wave of violent wahhabi jihad against peaceful muslims would continue,0
opposed rod pole and perch are used interchangeably though in practice rod is most often used in measuring the foot length but for area the use of perch is almost exclusive probably stemming from the perch also historically representing units if i recall correctly that defined both name and irish miles and acres whereas this didnt apply necessarily to pole and rod pretty certain the pole never referred to irish and name units,0

i think the formula is correct as it stands you can check it out on some test data eg loan of million for years monthly name gives half life as years near as d to months and using excels pv function for the remainder months we are a tad short of half way at with the minus sign in we get years oh dear derivation is from a continuous time mortgage model where the balance on a mortgage pt is given by the equation rinterest rate ttime period of loan and p0 is the original loan amount once again this is something i have derived for myself but no doubt also once again there are more authoritative sources,0

jmabel in regards to predominant scholary consensus who is it that allegedly claims despite third way rhetoric fascism in power functioned rather consistently as a rightwing force as far as im aware owning numerous books on the subject that is not the scholary consensus at all the consensus developed by respected scholars of fascism who write in a manner which is not bias to any interest group such as name name name and name all recongise fascism as a third way as the references show the only dissenters im aware of who seem to think fascism has absoutely no leftist connections and is merely a radical right system are street level socialists who want to put as much distance between the movements as possible this of course does not come from educated people in a position to write books for example even the foremost scholary expert on fascism and a former member of both the communist party and then socialist party of italy renzo de felice doesnt try to cover up its socialistic origins and third way status this is a man who has wrote a definitive seven volume piece on name,0
wikipediaarticles for deletioncheongye kwan your post at the above afd on a new martial art bothers me this was the version at the time that you based your post on you posted i just read the article and to be quite honest feel that it does satisfy wikipedias guidelines it is reliably sourced since i believe the notability of the article is satisfied it now has independent sources and to refute the argument posed by name it is determined by the phillip rhee source that the martial arts is not localised please consider the concerns this post raises simple matters like references notability and noobie basics of afds should be routine for any moderately experienced user and breadandbutter for any admin in fact a cursory check shows that almost everything you stated was i dont have a word for it unreal is close the eleven independent sources that you stated established notability and nonlocalization at the time were three references from coates robinson shaw certainly before the topic even existed and all related to a passing piece of news about its founder being on the team of a completely different sport in any event two references from 1st half davies white almost certainly identical and identically irrelevant to the topics notability the promoters personal page on his local town website almost certainly selfpublished official village website a casual interview in a nonnotable and possibly nonreliable university magazine apparently of the promoters travels to see experts in a different sport with tangential tiny sentence mention that hed discussed his new sport with them too the lau philip la interview entries marked reference and support of written reference name cook rhee obviously a request by the founder to a friendcolleague write a letter of support that was never published anyway and isnt cited so you cant have read it not that it was even possibly valid evidence a short writeup of a local information kind on the award of the first black belts by the school in its local paper in brief of the were before the sport existed and were not even remotely to do with the topic itself much less sourced material on it or substantial coverage they had precisely zero coverage were claims of personal i think is a great guy letters of support evidently solicited andor written on request with zero evidence of verifiable existence and certainly in no way reliably sourced or independent was selfwritten was the briefest of nonmentions in a nonreliable source pretty much i discussed the topic with them in a college magazine interview is local press coverage of his courses thats not even news for a day or evidence of anything beyond a course by this name is taught twice weekly in our local village hall your assessment of these at afd was it is reliably sourced styleborder solid 1px width there is barely one reliable source in all of those that the sport even exists in the first place a local newspaper mention that it meets in a village hall on tuesdays and fridays and just awarded its first black belts probably via selfpromotional input there is zero reliable sourcing for any of the rest that the cited pages are evidence of notability styleborder solid 1px width they dont mention it or even date from a time the topic existed nor are online versions provided how on earth could they reliably evidence it that the sources are independent styleborder solid 1px width are claims that please support me letters exist they are even stated to be personal references unpublished and uncited is his own clearly selfwritten web page on a local village web host that the cites show it is nonlocalized styleborder solid 1px width the page doesnt list a link so you cant have checked the cite yet you say the citation proves it the reference openly stated cambridge university and bristol taekwando a big indication of its actual source when a link was provided on request it turns out it,0

why will gwen name not read the sources on august i posted a section on talk death of adolf name titled random questions which started i am not a scholar i read name but would not think of editing it but i was disappointed in this article and many points in the discussion so i am asking some questions perhaps someone else will read and address them the section went on with several rethoritical questions and ended with as to sources the last books i have read are the murder of adolph name by name sort of shaky and the last days of name by name english translation i buy much of this gwen name was apparently assigned me as an administrator because at she replied with as the article lead saysthis said this talk page isnt a forum for talking about personal views or questions on a topic its meant for talking about sources and how to echo them in the text i say this because the article seems to already cover with thorough citations most if not all of what youve brought updodgy gwen name talk by this reply it appears that gwen name is not familiar with the work of name who i have just referenced and thinks that i am asking a personal question not a rhetorical one at that time i apologized tried to explain myself and restate my questions at i posted if i had read names nemesis chapter note and epilogue note i wouldnt have wasted your time you cant get much clearer than that should be required reading perhaps someone else should read them and possibly edit the article thank you for your time talk at i posted i would like to direct people to the work of ian name name nemesis isbn phone chapter and the epilogue relate to this article please pay attention to his notes and sources be warned his book name a biography is a kind of digest which does not include these resourcesthe source name is basically an english translation of a germans analysis of s postsoviet interviews of bunker survivors the original transcripts must be available somewhere there are many other bunker interviews some with questionable intent and not all agree wm5200 talk since those posts i have posted a huge amount on the talk page virtually all of which gwen name has disputed much of the material i have posted i have later deleted often because i felt that the endless conflict between gwen name and myself is counterproductive to the article anyone who is name can probably bring back any of those posts was i sometimes rude and argumentative absolutely was i making legitimate points which related to the article i thought so did i receive effective support and encouragement by my administrator i think not but you judge my main point was that name had reviewed the information and had made a solid case for positions which name backed i repeatedly begged anyone especially gwen name to read name and name specifically two footnotes i even told the pages of the footnotes gwen name clearly had not read either source i posted under the heading question for gwen name the following i lost you but i m confused myself it appears as though the person with the least information available is most influential on the article my very low budget suburb is in a system which serves people with million titles numbers approximate thanks carol name name name name beevor shirer name toland eberleuhl lehmanncarroll o donnell name petrovawatson vinogradov hit a snag reordered these are books which i have had in my possession and read parts of since aug i can understand if others do not have access to the same resources but i think that should be addressed if someone does not have access to two footnotes which are critical in a discussion that also should be addressedi know that this is pov and that i am personally involved but i can not help but believe that this article has problems with it s processwm5200 talk on gwen name posted for starters the russian autopsy bore overwhelming evidence he not only shot himself but bit down on a cyanide capsule gwen name talk by this post it is clear to anyone familiar with either name or name that gwen name is still not familiar with either work name was first referenced by me at august and name was referenced by me at august and i believe that they were both on t,0

i disagree nobody has yet made a case against the inclusion of statistical data when it s used in support of a discussion about causal theories which in this case it would be i recommend that people take a look at how this issue is handled by other similar wikipedia articles particularly race and intelligence which has been at least as hotly contested as this one although the focus of that article is on the various explanations that have been proposed for this iq difference the iq difference itself is considered central enough to the article that it s represented visually in this chart this image used to be part of the article also it was eventually removed because editors decided that it was original research but nobody there had a problem with the idea of this data being depicted with an image the original research claim obviously doesn t apply to an image from the doj website and i think all of the same principles that apply to race and intelligence apply here also the only question that needs to be considered is whether the data represented in the image is relevant to the article which in this case it clearly is,0

delete example would it be appropriate to delete the example section at the bottom mar utc i think so namet see what it adds mar utc yes moreover it is not an example of random variable its just a realization of random variable hardly misleading mar utc i thought this was very useful because it showed an example where the map was not the identity map i propose putting it back false statement a continuous random variable does not always have a density preceding unsigned comment added by definition i namet like the definition here not that im letting my ignorance of stats stop me from commenting but could this be considered a clearer definition random variable the outcome of an experiment need not be a number for example the outcome when a coin is tossed can be heads or tails however we often want to represent outcomes as numbers a random variable is a function that associates a unique numerical value with every outcome of an experiment the value of the random variable will vary from trial to trial as the experiment is repeated there are two types of random variable discrete and continuous a random variable has either an associated probability distribution discrete random variable or probability density function continuous random variable i think this is definitely an improvement but it should be pointed out that there exists rvs which are neither discrete nor continuous for example take the sum of one rv of each type the current definition is bad in that it is neither clear to the lay reader nor specific to the technical reader the above definition is far better on both counts and so i will put it on the page btw sorry about the no summary edit i hit the enter key accidentally examples a coin is tossed ten times the random variable x is the number of tails that are noted x can only take the values so x is a discrete random variable a light bulb is burned until it burns out the random variable y is its lifetime in hours y can take any positive real value so y is a continuous random variable i think the above definition for the original reference pls search via google explains to me that it is a mapping between a value and the sequence number of that value rather like a numeric index to a database record this would appear to allow greater generalization in statistical definitions and algorithms the earler wikiedia definition led me to comment on another wikipedia definition incorrectly because i think i may have misunderstood the concept after looking at this wikipedia definition a random variable is a function that assigns a numerical value to an event this example just assigns another event to an event could we change it to something like consider a game where if a is rolled on a fair sixsided die player wins and otherwise player wins let x represent the number of times player wins then and or maybe include an example of a continuous random variable what do you think this section should begin with a sentence of the form a random variable is to avoid this is to show that you name,0

fantastic thank you thats extremely helpful that biography contains details of his early and late life that do not exist in the other sources ive got his time in paris pretty well fleshed out names reminiscences in perfect name are full of juicy details im still trying to understand all the orthodox religious references in some of my other sources eg two resurrections im a little out to sea on some of that its hard to write about his tone method without doing forbidden original research because it seems no one has really studied it in depth name maybe more than anyone else i really want to look at one of the scores now if only i had a public domain illustration or two anyhow now i can cite that biography thanks to you im presuming that the world encyclopedia in russian is a reliable source everything sounds right and matches up with name and the others ive got name talk,0
no piotrus i think ssr addition wouldnt be enough in fact i find the issue of prewar partition of poland hardly relevant here we can assume that the polish communities would form their distinct attitude towards nazis and partisans anyway no matter how many years ago polish state was lost i believe its more about ethnicity and religion however if you insist on mentioning the partition issue two thesises need to be stressed in the text there were territories previously under polish and under soviet rule those territories were multiethnic at the time not polish significantly belarusianukrainian as well ill suggest my text formulation later and i hope these my opinions will be considered when writing new specific articles from polish perspective,0
however you didnt sign your edits and in fact attempted to make them look as if theyd been placed there in some official capacity so that someone just looking at the page and not checking the edit history would not know they were placed there by a user who simply desperately wishes they were an admin rather than an admin please find some other way to fill the void in your life than playing defender of the wiki and making things personal when someone disagrees with you because frankly at this point i care far less about the entry itself and more your despicable and infuriating behavior,0

i understand your point i simply do not believe it to be valid during the period in question the rc church did not have large armies at its disposal it relied on secular powers to take heed of its views in france name a loyal catholic hated the concept of religious toleration the rc church at this time were also opposed to this principle one that has become so widely accepted in western societies that it is often difficult to imagine a time before name with the tactic support of leading name ordered acts of antiprotestant terror lets be completely honest without the tactic approval of the church would a devout catholic have been committed to such a course of action some leading name celebrated the outcome a france almost completely cleansed of protestants now in all the material the criticism of the rc church is so obviously implied that this shouldnt need reemphasising a modern historian would not write the following is a criticism of the rc church that is how junior school children begin their english composition answers,0

well i might consider and then might even agree with you that perhaps one could point me to wpdbad here spelled in a form of euphemism for my potential benefit as i consider you had pointed me but that still hasnt given any solutions to the disagreement which goes on the talk page here i mean the talkinternational recognition of kosovo page as far as the wprm if this is what you had in mind is concerned my opinion is that the third conversator thinks other of the procedure im still not sure that there is one moreover im certain that for the time being he doesnt think of another pov of the procedure because of this words of his which are somehow unclear at least to me any new proposals will be speedy closed persistence will be dealt with sanctions as per the wparbmac probation this article is under the scope of concerning the closure of proposal im not sure if he meant new proposals through the talk page of international recognition of kosovo irok or through the wprm actually i find wprm somehow vague on the sequence of steps to be taken when new requestproposal is to be made ive tried to follow the procedure proposed as it is given at wprm but then i might misunderstood something i might consider asking for explanation on the very own projects page as for that matter hus as a formalist as i consider you at the moment i must ask you now this when you wrote all controversial move proposals must go through in order to have any validity you actully wanted to write all controversial move proposals should go throughin order to have any validity i suppose i pointed out one might consider ive used irony i apologize to those to the ambiguity of interpretation of the potential procedure since the very procedure hasnt been tagged as a guideline but still named a project to the least maybe some other place exists which im not aware of i apologize in advance for me being somewhat a whiner since ive been passive and not searching for potential one myself not to mention judgemental and still nonconstructive enough to contribute myself although recognition of the problem might be considered as form of contiributing action sorry for that ijanderson977 you asked why are you not claiming that this article has a pov title international recognition of abkhazia and south ossetia well actually i do consider this title is biased also but personally i consider the irok more globally important not just to me as one might think it is if the bias is dealt with this issue irok title it could be dealt elsewhere also and imho it is good to keep the discussion in one place maybe creating a new page where this discussion concerning the term recognition or more could be taken should be considered as an idea all the best s talk,0

note the current lead implies israeli aggression against hamas by stating that israel killed several hamas members in name on july and hamas retaliated with rockets i have been trying to seek consensus for including the israeli claim that hamas started firing rockets circa june at drn however it may also be worth noting that israel maintains the hamas members killed in name accidentally blew themselves up in one of their tunnels hamas has vowed revenge for what it saw as israels deadliest attacks in which six palestinian militants died though israel denied any involvementthe israeli military said its aircraft had targeted terror sites and concealed rocket launchers in the enclave but had not hit the southern gaza area of rafah on the egyptian border where the hamas gunmen died military spokesman name said the militants had died when explosives went off in a tunnel that israel had bombed several days ago fearing gunmen planned to use it to try and penetrate into israel it turns out the same account was given by the new york times when hamas militants entered the damaged tunnel a day or so later they apparently set off explosives therehamas blamed israel escalating the hostilities that grew into the current confrontation hamas claim that seven of its members were killed by an israeli airstrike is not an assertion wikipedia should parrot uncritically,0

narciso yepess revolutionary technical developments this is a story that has been recounted numerous times by yepes and by his students you know the guitar is a very unusual instrument for it seems that in every city of the world there is a great genius of the guitar someone who knows every single thing there is to know about the guitar someone whos genius is so great that he or she can learn nothing from anyone else however i have never felt that way about myself when i was around i could play virtually everything written for the guitar but i knew i needed a teacher so i went to see a composer and music teacher by the name of name a very famous man in spain the first thing he asked me to play was a musical scale i played a standard guitar scale using alternating i and m fingers and i played it about as well as any guitarist i had ever heard name told me that my scale was not acceptable he played a scale on the piano which was much faster than any guitarist could play a scale then he picked up a violin and played a scale much faster than i could play he showed me a musical scale on several other orchestral instruments and told me that this is how he expected me to play a scale if i was to be a musician i tried again to match his accepted norm for scales but i could not do so i then told him that this could not be done on the guitar and in fact no one at the time could play guitar scales at the tempos name and others were using on standard classical instruments he told me too bad but if you want to study music with me you must give up the guitar i expect you to be able to execute scales at the tempos that have long been the norm well i had two choices one was to be the genuis of the guitar to get mad and storm out the door the other choice was to swallow my pride and to accept name as my teacher where i would be obligated to perform at the level of his other students fortunately i chose to stay and learn for the door was open for name to be my teacher and i chose to swallow my pride and study with him and this decision has made all the difference i went home thought about scales and realized that no pianist could play such rapid scales when using only two fingers on the right hand i started using three fingers instead ami mia name and the next week i was able to play a musical scale he smiled and told me that i did not have to give up the guitar after all then he asked me for a chromatic scale in 3rds and again the technique used for classical guitar at that time could not execute what other instrumentalists were doing by the next week i had figured out a way to play 3rds at the accepted tempo thus we went week after week and i continued to solve the difficulties to his satisfaction eventually i had developed a revolutionary technique for the guitar as a result of the experience i have come to understand one thing the minute a guitarist decides he or she is a genius and pridefully refuses to enter when the door is open to a qualified teacher is the minute when that guitarist has brought his or her art to a dead end you may also wish to look up yepess threefingered scalestrills techniques most guitarists are clueless as to the mechanicaltechnical theory of this they think it is just repeating a m i over and over again but it goes with a mechanical theory that is ingenius and as all great ideas so simple and logical it is amazing that no guitarist in the hundreds of years before yepes ever realized this theory and that is just one of the many new techniques yepes invented you may add your citation needed comments to call this into question but it will not take away the facts of yepess achievements,0
as i have said before its not the motives its the results of them motives i can read and im smart enough to see smear campaign when its in front of me now i would suggest you make sure the name a retired republican office holder dont be come a dump site of lies fanciful speculations guilt by associationad hominem attacks red herring fishing trips and all purpose character assassination and ends up reading like huge democratic attack piece see wpatp also i consider your refactoring and reformatting my words on my talk page to be rude and abusive and you should stop it i have seen the warnings and acknowledged them now i will remove them,0
no violation copied the almost same comment from an3 and added some for getting a quick response with all due respect i think it is a clear violation on 3rr and civility according to wikipediathreerevert rule an editor must not perform more than three reverts in whole or in part on a single page within a hour period a revert means undoing the actions of another editor whether involving the same or different material each time moreover im getting a threat by the editor why is he free of any sanction,0
johnny test i dont know whether it properly belongs there or not either but it is in the teletoon original series template and is listed at list of teletoon original series so if it is in fact wrong then those have to be corrected as well rather than just reverting the addition of a category that both the list and the template are indicating is correct,0

my purpose was to point out the chronological sequence of events error by pointing out that the belknap incident preceded the name incident with the latter being just as or more important in the decision concerning the use of aluminum on warships i agree that my response could have been laconic but needed to precise to discourage deletion however my first posting was deleted unceremoniously and without comment userretrograde62 pst april utc,0
unfortunately you are an undeniable feeble person who misrepresents reality of the name fellowship as someone who does not legitimately publish the name book and is a failure with only as you say hundreds of members the name readersintl has hundreds of readers worldwide in places such as denmark saudi arabia europe korea etc your self repressed reality is necessary for you to get through each day of your bitter resentful life the name readersintl hosts world wide internet meetings and has a monthly mailing list that encompasses continents who still happens to host an annual get together in florida for the prior members of the name association of florida the name book fellowship is nothing more then a ban of radical beguiled readers who desire nothing more then to create a golden calf of a an idolatrous name church to appease their pagan animal nature anyone not self repressed enough to understand simple religious psychology can already see this in you deep down inside you know this is true but your subliminal self hatred keeps you in denial of such facts and as such we are going to ask that you please discontinue removing the name readersintl group and replacing it with the fellowship link see how that works in contrast so you want to play sound games or do you want to fight fire with fire name as such let us repeat the same again if you delete us we delete you fellowship if you put the name book fellowship link back in and keep ours in the we keep yours in if you place the name book fellowship link above us we will place our link above you you want a war you got it,1
i saw the name had been removed i tagged it as unreviewed initially due to the poor quality of the article which i thought had been marked as reviewed hastily before seeing that you had added a csd which was removed sorry for the above i had no idea it was sent and i only unreviewed it as it needed something doing i just reported the remover as a likely sock thanks,0

omg you are an imbecile seriously lets go over this one last time on the remote chance you might finally understand the difference between fact and opinion i rewrote the contribution using only information that i found on the internet that supported the contribution i did not add anything to the story that could not be verified through a reliable source you on the other hand wrote a contribution that did add content to the story that could not be verified through a reliable source making it your opinion you said things like when a neighboring police agency was needed and requested by the chief of police to intervene in the criminal conduct of arvadas police force this is libelous because you accuse the arvada police department of criminal conduct when no criminal conduct has been proven in a court of law even the officer who is alleged to have done the hitting has been found not guilty by your peers because no one is convicted in the link you provide or any link anywhere on the internet it is your opinion if you had used the phrase alleged criminal conduct you would be more on track you also wrote arvadas city council had chosen not to intervene in the previous criminal conduct of several members of the arvada police despite a cost to the city of close to half a million dollars defending the criminal actions of one police officer alone during a period of budget crises the close to half a million dollars was not spent defending the criminal actions of one police officer alone the money was spent settling out of court so that the accusations had no opportunity to be proven as fact a criminal is someone who has been convicted of a crime so there cannot be criminal actions unless someone has been convicted of a crime there can be alleged questionable actions which is what you should have written when you post hateful things about others that is just your opinion that opens you up to a libel suit if you do it in a blog and you make it clear that you are expressing your opinion and not facts you can say whatever you like there without much fear of libel but when you post to a site whose premise is encyclopedic content you cannot just post what you think you must post what can be verified do you understand this very basic principle please read it again if you dont because im done trying to educate you definition of libel i encourage you to visit the link and read all its contents libel involves false statements knowingly presented as fact in the united states opinion is protected as a tenant of freedom of speech falling outside the purview of libel citizens retain the right to comment on public figures and entities including government and officials entertainment parody editorials and criticisms that may arguably misrepresent facts are not libelous so long as they are presented for amusement or stated as mere opinion from how to prove libel there are several ways a person must go about proving that libel has taken place for example in the united states the person first must prove that the statement was false second that person must prove that the statement caused harm and third they must prove that the statement was made without adequate research into the truthfulness of the statement these steps are for an ordinary citizen you are unable to be objective about the content you are writing because you have a personal emotional feeling or opinion about it because of this you have no business contributing to wikipedia and its my opinion that you should be banned from doing so ive made several contacts on this issue and am waiting to hear back,0

after studying the phenomenon of electrolysis in the angloirish physicist name suggested that there existed a single definite quantity of electricity he was able to estimate the value of the charge e of a monovalent ion by means of faradays laws of electrolysis this means that chemistry is part of the definitio if the electron the value of charge was equated to faradays laws of electrolysis there should be an section in the electron article on chemistry and if your going to mention obscure virtual electrons why not mention chrystal fields because that is fundamental to chemistry if your going to mention quantum physics why cant you mention quantum chemsitry because i think chemistry is just as important to physics if not more important and i think there should be a section on electrolysis,0

will arbitration finally be needed to stop the bigoted attacks i fear that certain editors here have not heeded the recent warnings whatsoever and are proceeding full steam ahead with attempting to make this bible article a full fledged onesided pov job with insulting inflammatory and derogatory rhetoiric being directed at all those who take this story seriously there is only one way to get this travesty to end and that is with more level of arbitration we know there are antichristian and antijewish bigots in the world always have been no doubt about that why do we have to allow them to come here and spout their intolerance nonstop the way these sad sacks look at christians and jews whom they always label with derogatory sounding labels like fundamentalist and conservative is reminiscent of the way name felt about jews except these mental dwarfs include christians as well involving a much greater proportion of the population as their target they are poisoning the environment with their bigotry this is a plea to arbitration for remedy talk,1

this article is being rewritten at jack abramoffabramoffrefactor please take note of the existing notes and outline and follow in the spirit of that rewriterefactor comments welcome thanks archives archive friday 12th august talkname i made some substantial edits to the page and archived the entire earlier talk since it was mostly to do items since dealt with copyvio this article and its sister screed are embarrassments to wikipedia theyre essentially the same and both reflect the authors politocal hatred and zeal both also have severe irredemable copyright problems and are and embarrasment to wikipedia they need to be deleted immediately alot of this article does seem to be a blatent copyvio tyco as below was edited the text was accurate but half the news story was pasted in here you cannot just wholesale paste in paragraphs of text from a news story attribute a link and it not be a copywrite violation its called plagerism tyco almost the whole tyco section is a blatent rip from the wapo article ive removed part of it as it needs to be rewritten i think ive cleaned much of the copyvio stuff up hopefully there is alot of nonessential stuff in this article about peripheral people and not about abramoff however it needs to be cleaned up more as the article meanders alot here and there i reverted some things you took out outside the tyco section like in the early years section and in the intro about name that material is not copyright infringement because it is properly sourced when directly quoted it still needs to be rewritten to not be a direct copy paste unless you are going to quote it just providing a link is not attribution and copying entire paragraphs out of an article is plagiarism not fair use unless you are quoting also if you are going to say the los angeles times reports you need to source the times not a secondary source ie democracy now i modified the quote and attributed properly the speech from tom name is a direct quote its in quotations so of course it is taken wordforword from the source ill tweak the setup to the quote a little better as per your request heres the primary source for the other thing no problem if i see something that is probable copyvio i tend to chop it out first and then rework it i dont usually just leave it out if the quote is accurate btw have you found a link for the franken quote i cant find anything other than on blogs honestly im not sure what the relevence to an article on abramoff is really anyway the forced abortions part was originally reported by name at abc news for on march it also appears in al frankens book the truth with jokes in the tom name saipan sex tour and name getaway chapter since weve agreed that primary sources are key ive change the attribution in the article the indian tribes scandal this area is a mess i have tried to clean it up a bit and structure it better it may be best to create a new page on the tribes scam and point the reed norquist etc pages to it basically we need fewer facts and more context at the moment the page is simply a list of transactions that may or may not have been legit with a strong implication that they were not legit i moved the whole scandal to its own page this makes much more sense since although abramoff is a major player in that scandal there are several others who are significant players in particular name i am not doing this to hide the scandal i think that people looking for info on i,0

name by your signature we can tell how biased you are and the reason why youd want to add defamatory material to names article well it aint going happen here are the facts name was in brazil to help train the doicodi and dops torturers for this reason he was gunned down by the vpr militant group in name was never a member of the vpr at that time she was a member of another organization called colina she would later join var palmares in therefore there are absolutely no links whatsoever between name and the assassination of name,0

the net effect is that you deleted a bunch of content plus which there is more to say about each individual rate construction particulars for instance plus it doesnt work with the categorization system when thinking about merging articles one important thing to consider is whether the article is small because its new and needs more content or it will always be small in the case of the rn rates all have much to say about them rationale evolution employment plus a picture or two so we can see what they looked like this article should be about the system as a whole who introduced it and why when did it go out of use how did it compare to other nations systems once you have adequate treatment of all that plus the two screenfuls with two representative pictures per rate thats a pretty hefty article no longer easy for reader to get the basic definition of thirdrate when considering organization like this its worthwhile to look at history of all the articles concerned and maybe query the editors who set it up because what youve effectively done is to destroy article structure that i and others carefully set up some time ago talk pages are mostly used for debate so lack of talk page bits combined with multiple editors in history indicates that all the editors agreed perfectly no need to discuss sep utc,0

name input if you were in communication with an admin and were actively working on it you or the admin should have actually put a valid hangon message on the talk page quite frankly i dont believe the draft article youre working on is ready to go for the following reasons theres a number of grammar and spelling errors name should not have caps except for first letter and should not be wikilinks bolding is for the first use of the subject in the lead paragraph only references shouldnt be generalized like youve put them individual facts in the article should be footnoted to the references see wpfn and wpcitet if you dont know how to do this the section on search engine submission software should be omitted entirely as its covered in a separate article dont duplicate material thats what wiki links are for move the reasons why its notable media coverage awards to the 1st or 2nd paragraph please be aware that wikipedia is not a howto guide so instructional information about how to use the software is not appropriate you can eliminate the further reading as the book is in the refs and get rid of the dummies graphic its not relevant to the particular programit looks like youre plugging the book akradeckispeaketh retrieved from,0

it should be noted that traditioning in most martial arts including name mostly is not a martial art anymore due to the adoption of instinctive fighting techniques of the upper bodyboxing as it is calledand many other martial art techniques not exclusive to name or name etc women are not considered true martial artists anyway that is because the arts are designed used mastered and needed by men and its techniques are supposed to play to the strengths of a man a womans training dating back centuries was an emphasis on wounding the target with a basic attack and running this is one of the many reasons escorts where provided it is sad what has happened to name and tkd in the modern schools on average in the emphasis on sport and money from children practionersby way of parents unconditioned elders and women but that is another debate regardless female fighters are not to show any signs of claiming equality to a male fighter since the potential is clearly lacking like it or not gender is of the physical mental and in my opinion the spiritual as well play to its strengths not its weaknesses it is the opposite sex that helps you compensate for your weaknesses due to your gender,0

canonicity in general ive been involved in a long discussion over on talkname device over whether the name in the movie is the same thing as the name in the series with centrx arguing that they arent and that discussing the name in just one article was deceitful i dont think his argument is at all valid but in the course of looking stuff up on the web ive discovered that some fans of the movie apparently consider the sg series to be somehow illegitimate or noncanon im not familiar with the name fan community just the show itself so i dont feel comfortable adding discussion of this directly to the article does anyone know any details about this such as how widespread this apparent schism is jul utc,0

maybe irrelevant wasnt the ideal word choice i wouldnt remove a photo of a bostonlocated school from the boston page but id be a bit skeptical of its inclusion its just that there are something like schools in the metroboston area even if you limit it to the more notable ones mit harvard bc bu name emerson suffolk others im probably forgetting which one do you pick you cant put an image for every campus into that section so which one is sufficiently representative also i get the impression theres a minor status war between bc or bu and probably other schools regarding which one is depicted as the best school on wikipedia so i think edits like the bc photo addition that could potentially be construed as marketing should be closely scrutinized what do you think,0

warning templates on others reverts sorry about that but i find many editors revert without warning the perp what leads to me leaving a message on another editors revert is when we both do the same revert but the other editor hits return a second or two before i do since im already on the history page i look to see if a warning was added i generally try to wait a bit before saving the warning but as i say a lot of warnings would not be left if i just assumed reverting editors were going to leave one incidentally i sometimes get edit conflicts on a perps talk page from an editor warning on a different instance of vandalism sometimes even to the same page some of them crank out the garbage edits at an amazing rate anyway sorry if it puzzled you talk,0
im sorry if you will not like the answer but i can not accept any wording indeed any word in the article that does not reflect or is reflected in sources would any of your patients be happy with an almost successful operation i care even less about the yugoslav media then i do about yugoslav politics it may not be what you want to hear either all i can do is repeat that there is no way in this world that the yugoslav troops were operating under independent command during this offensive its is just laughable even if i had no way to substantiate what i said journalists may write what they want but ask any military officer and heshe will tell you its inconceivable for the size of the op comms,0

the usa under the confederation may have had the same name as the modernday usa but it was not the modernday usa the usa confederation and the usa union or also called nation are different entities the argument can be made that while the usa confederacy was a firm league of friendship among a number of free and independent states the usa union was a separate political entity that although it replaced the usa league was something completely different saying that the name was the first constitution of the usa and then providing a link to the modernday united states is misleading my point the article as it currently stands is incorrect because it asserts that the name was the constitution of a union that did not yet exist although the political body in place did have the superficial similarity of having the same name and the verifiable reliable sources which support my interpretation are the declaration of independence and the name of confederation and perpetual union perhaps i didnt express my convictions eloquently enough to be understood since the differences are not easy to distinguish if im not clear in my explanation point to the unclear parts and ask me to reexplain,0

i can tell you what the argument is about here newseventsguy its about your retroactive reversion of a simple edit trying to include secondary independent verification of sedimentary nanodiamonds in younger dryas sediments by bement and name et al without discussion a reference that i notice has not yet been included in the reference list still after all this time this is after you admit that you are ignorant of the peer review literature and the controversy any attempt to do simple reference list edits on this page have been stomped by no less that five admittedly biased and ignorant editors the honorable thing to do here would be to recuse yourself from editing the page as i have but i havent seen that happening until now good luck with it youve already made complete fools of yourselves,1
your source states about the black white difference in iq which at the time was about points the name et al article stated there is not much direct evidence on this point but what there is fails to support a genetic hypothesis that conclusion stands today there has been no new direct evidence on the question see rushton jensen 2005a 2005b name and lynn vanhanen for the view that the black white iq difference is owing substantially to genetic differences between the races and that indirect evidence having to do with such factors as reaction time and brain size is probative see name for the view that the direct evidence indicates that thedifference between the races is entirely due to environmental factors and that the indirect evidence has little value please stop lying then applying the same defintion to c the answer is no do you see the problem here question c2 is the hereditiarian position a mainstream view the question is whether it is a widely held mainstream view that the iq test score gap is likely to be significantly explainable by genetic factors note that the question is not whether it is the only mainstream view nor whether it has been proven to account for the entire gap but only about whether it is considered a probable explanation by a wide selection of mainstream scholars yes question d2 is richard name considered a mainstream scientist the question is whether name as a person and a scholar is generally considered to be within the mainstream of the field of psychology the question is not whether he is prominent and notable enough to be included but about whether his views should be given equal weight to mainstream views within the article no name holds a minority view which has been described as having virtually no chance of being true by a reliable tertiary source,0

to expand on one aspect of that wikipedias three main content policies are wpneutral point of view which peridon mentioned wpverifiability all quotations and any material challenged or likely to be challenged must be attributed to a reliable published source the threshold for inclusion in wikipedia is verifiability not truth whether readers can check that material in wikipedia has already been published by a reliable source not whether editors think it is true wpno original research the term original research or is used on wikipedia to refer to material such as facts allegations and ideas for which no reliable published source exists the last two mean that content based on your extensive participation in two of the three events making me very knowledgeable of what occurred both in public and private with a bare minimum of conjecture is not acceptable as a basis for additions to the article i hope your question is adequately answered so i have turned off the helpme please add another if you need more advice regards,0

i dont believe the name criticism present there conforms with the npv rule name doesnt have a neutral point of view to begin with if an offer to polygraph or even concerned review of polygraph results shocks a complainant into thinking her lies have been uncovered the recantation is still perfectly valid if you know you are telling the truth you will argue with machine or investigator also part of kanins research was a followup of the recanted story where possible to verify if any were false recantations in all followups the recanted version of events matched what the accused said happened arguing that name is a respected phd is baseless if kanin is a respected phd i agree that my edit wasnt as neutral as possible though so apologize for that still something must be done here,0

issue on images still unresolved i appreciate your inputs in image talkmonkey3jpg and i agree once in a while i might sound rude purely unintentional since i put facts blantly but namevirgin is abusing his admin power to overrule anyone name is not a he given that she named herself after a javanese princess perhaps you could take the hint and note that shes a woman also i dont think you were simply blunt i think you were rude to name i recognise its a fine line but given that ive mentioned it to you perhaps youll take more care to stay on the right side of it she has suggested in an email to me that she is in talks with another editor now i dont know who this other editor and i certainly dont like this secrecy instead of having a discussion on this she wants to finish the matter begind closed doors she couldve atleast told me who this reputed editor was to let me have a word with himher perhaps she is seeking guidance on how she should approach you and wants that to be untainted by your input i think that would be reasonable i have a high regard for name and i dont think she would have a nefarious purpose in speaking to a third party name far as the images are concerned i had stated to her a couple of images on one issue animal rights is ok but she insists she needs to showcase the entire album provided by peta and its assocites so you have a dispute you need to recognise that you are not necessarily right you disagree about how many images are necessary i feel that you have to allow that your disagreement might be fuelled by your political differences as much as how you interpret the image policy this should could easily achieve by providing an external link to the images provided by a controversial organization the buav is not a controversial organisation it is a highly respected body whose voice is listened to in all circles of british society a viewpoint doesnt become controversial just because you dont share it wikipedia is supposed to be neutral and not have extreme viewpoints but you expect it to reflect your viewpoint thus i requested her to limit her fair use policy in this regard to images which can be used across similar articles this she refuses i dont see how it is any fairer to use one two or ten images in this instance while i agree that name could have taken more care to provide a rationale for using the images i simply dont feel that your argument about how many she should have used has much weight one factor in deciding fair use is how much of a thing you use thats true but its only one factor and obviously each picture is a separate case to be considered as well as part of a whole as far as the other images some are on personalities she claims have agreed to use their photos here unless she gets a written consent and a permission how can i believe first of all you can believe name because you assume good faith perhaps youre not aware of that policy yes you can ask name to provide evidence of that but your assumption should be that she has in fact acquired that agreement harassing another editor to provide evidence to your satisfaction and insisting you wont believe them until they have do not show an assumption of good faith once i pointed out that permission photos would be deleted anyway she backed off and argued that it be kept on the grounds of fair use asking me to trust her yes okay trust her and ask for proof both of us are editing in good faith but one of us has power and a circle of friends to back her while the other me relies on the hope that ppl like you will help me out in this id urge you to rely on the issues rather than the personalities yes name does have powerful friends who will back her regardless but you should still do your best to make it about the issue in question and not about her if she gets away with this and sets a precedence then im afraid there are hordes of copyviolaters straining at the leashes to bomb wikipedia with copyrighted information i think thats a bit dramatic but i agree that she has to obey the rules which exist for good reason and shouldnt be given a pass just because she is friends with the arbcom however she is not a copyviolater trying to destroy wikipedia partly i think she simply didnt understand your problem and that was in part a failure of your communication and partly she has become too used to having her views echoed by her friends and doesnt handle disagreement well so perhaps you could recognise that and be more helpful than combative i know,0

i agree with that georgian scripts would be a better title or perhaps georgian alphabets or georgian writing although this might be confused with georgian literature i certainly agree with the proposer that the present name is unsatisfactory as the article covers three distinct scripts and at least alludes to the existence of more than one mkhedruli alphabet that said i don t have a strong objection to georgian script which would at least be an improvement and seems to line up with the latin and cyrillic articles the latter seems to me particularly worth emulating in comprising a range of regional historical varieties,0
yes i agree the article could do with some expansion id also like to see something on waist scabbards verses back scabbards seems as though the design of a back scabbard would have to be rather different to allow one to even draw a sword from it over ones shoulder at least if my fooling around with faux swords is any indication,0

i was just released from prison on december during the period ending about november i engaged in a day hunger strike actually and days started pounds ended up an estimated pounds generally i drank two cups of milk in the morning and drank water as needed i was never forcefed nor oddly enough was i ever hungry or in appreciable discomfort i was examined almost daily by prison medical staff probably the reason that i did so well was that i understood that the most important thing is to maintain the bodys electrolytes calcium potassium sodium magnesium phosphate and to consume just enough aminoacids to supply neurotransmitters if you merely drink water after a couple weeks youll lose enough electrolytes to cause an imbalance and youll feel terrible most people attribute this to not eating but i learned that its actually due to the electrolyte imbalance not the lack of calories at the time the longest hunger strike id ever heard of was referred to in the capote book in cold blood by name in the early s days i could probably have gone two more months,0
about your gan on super mario galaxy i noticed that you nominated super mario galaxy as a good article i read the article for a bit and there was an image of the cover of the game but there is no screenshot of the game as to illustrate the gameplay graphics or whatever good articles must include not only the cover of the game but a screenshot of the game as well some free images are optional to put in the article so what i wouldve done is add a screenshot of the game before nominating it as a good article,0

thanks for the reply but i made the suggestion to the editor of the board but he would not listen or even discuss the issue i have stated that the editor has maintained his own personal views into the article the editor stated i should go and seek this dispute resolution because as far as he is concerned he doesnt want anything that he doesnt agree with on articles linked to sikhism which i deem very one sided and a bit intolerant thanks i would like this issue sorted i have offered to create an orthodox and unorthodox section on diet in sikhism i have presented the same scholars that where in the original article that the editor cited himself yet when i cited the same scholars to show that they themselves agree that their are passages against meat and many sects against it the current editor of diet in sikhism again took it off how can a person cite a scholar and then reject my use of the same scholar when it doesnt fit in with his own pov which he stated as only being orthodox i know wiki also has information on shia unorthodox sect of islam does that mean we only adhere to one persons view on sikhism when that person has cited sholars that openly admit that their are passages against meat if that is the case then why cant relevant verses be shown thanks again i only reponded on here because to be honest im getting lost with all the forms on wikipedialol,0

this is untrue i have not been blocked for the reasons mentioned but rather for entirely different reasons since the reasons mentioned are not actually true it is impossible to exhibit a battleground attitude because of many reasons including the fact that one cannot exhibit something unless one is a display engineer at a museum and it would therefore be impossible to exhibit anything let alone a battleground attitude the fact that there is no such thing as a battleground attitude the fact that there is no such thing as an attitude in regards to how a human being acts and the fact that the word exhibit is used in an incorrect manner here done solely for the purpose of antagonizing the user antagonizing me usage of words like exhibit and attitude and refusing to follow the section title requirements on my page show an obvious malfeasance intent by the above person and therefore the block cannot be valid because within the first sentence he has already seriously demonstrated his lack of appropriate intent by specifically and purposefully being antagonizing the second claim is physically possible but is blatantly false i have specifically attempted to prevent other users from refusing to communicate in a appropriate manner as he was repeatedly replying to the same conversation in several different locations for which i reported him but yet the people at the alleged help desk refused to tell me where to report him and even deleted several of my replies and then archived it fraudulently having other users delete my comments participate in blatant fradulentism post the same thing on multiple talk pages at once for the purpose of harassing me etc is hardly myself making it difficult to communicate when in fact as was just demonstrated i did the literal exact opposite of this by literally attempting to prevent other users from making it difficult to communicate in addition if i wish for other users to not communicate with me i also have that right it is in fact specifically written into law in every state in the country and will get you arrested if you fail to do so although i personally disagree with this law and it is an immoral law which deems to prevent for example exspouses from communicating with each other when necessary the part of the law that refers to strangers such as on wikipedia or anywhere on the internet it is a personal choice whether you wish other strangers on the site to communicate with you or not andor post contact information etc that is why every message board in existence has an option to disable the private messaging system there were no personal attacks done by me anywhere so this part is a baseless and fraudulent claim refusal to abide by the sites guidelines is impossible since guidelines and rules are two different thing wikipedia does not have any rules and all policies of any kind are subject to debate and protest at any time according to the numerous wikipedia articles which specifically say this you have also demonstrated more incorrect intent by saying that something was done in multiple venues even though no venues of any kind exist because this is a website rather then a collection of several different building which show concerts or other entertainment events andor conventions andor etc so that is also impossible,0

first of all i have told to many pages from the first day that the account is coming from an office that giorgos works and that is giorgos that told me of what is going on here in relation with the discrimination personal attacks enforcement of an anticypriot propaganda deleting all edits that do not follow this anticypriot propaganda despite their well sourced evidence the double standards in blocking the blocking of anyone that is basically not following a specific anticypriot agenda on the matters of cyprus after a war edit by a specific team the same team that is trying to enforce its own agenda on cyprus matters and trying to block anyone else from editing propaganda tactics etc everything has to do with a discrimination the effort to dictate personal attacks and the effort to enforce an anticypriot propaganda on cyprus second giorgos is not writing in wikipedia anymore so he has no active account third as i see all the things that giorgos is saying are true you can block the account and you can block it forever if you please i will take the matter to the highest levels and we will speak from there i will give all the names and all the evidence necessary and i if i dont see anything happening you will see all the users involved in this in popular newspapers and newsportals and often explaining exactly what happened what is happening and what is going on with evidence evidence matters to the rest of the world in contrast with here,0

as i suspected complete nonsense your statement is so silly that i cant begin to tell you how wrong it is you said you there presume that your notyetfiled arbcom case has been decided i assure you that this was not the case i would consider that to be a stupid assumption i am not a stupid person i would therefore ask that you assume good faith on my part and withdraw everything on this page based on your mindreading trick you quote out of context and misrepresent when you describe part of my questioning as the lack the intellectual ability comment by the perverted interpretation of standards you are trying to apply to me your accusation of me not treating others as human beings is a personal attack if it wasnt so silly i would spend time thinking more on it which may lead to concluding that it is a straight up personal attack heres a few points for you to think on wpcivil wpagf wpnpa are all policies written in mind for the writing of encyclopaedic articles then lets consider the arbcom an article what then is this articles content name lets see the arbcom is an article so what is the arbcom made of why members so that means the content of the committee is its members so an election is a decision on the content of this article so members are editors so content is editors so in order to write this article we must discuss the content we must discuss the editor who is to become part of the content you dont like that wpcivil wpagf wpnpa are all policies written in mind for the writing of encyclopaedic articles but arbcom is not an article it is an election to decide which persons are to be members of that important committee we must discuss the editors who are to become members of the committee we cannot question articles about their content nor can we ask the content questions but we can ask the proposed contents of the arbcom questions is a certain level of intellectual ability pertinent to arbcom membership if you do not think so how many of the present arbcom do you consider stupid would a low intellect on arbcom help or hinder if there is evidence a diff of intellectual failings does the candidate realise this failing can he explain it as something other than an intellectual failing the questions were politely put they were challenging and they were meant to be and anyone in the community which includes me has the right to ask candidates challenging questions on their past performance there was no name calling all questions were relevant to a quality of the candidate pertinent to his ability to perform on arbcom they were not deferential which may be the actual cause of the consternation you and others displayed your threats of blocks i regard as an attempt to bully do not try to bully me finally i would contrast the participation of admins in this ani with the marshalling of forces which you participated in and then came here,0

hu12 administrator apparent libel and abuse report to a chair hello this is a request to review an apparently libelous and abusive comment made about a living person at the talk page for mount hood done by administrator hu12 toward the bottom at the issue stems from as youll see in the articles history section my interest in adding a simple climbing record listing for name with the press article references hu12s post after going through the google results a disturbing education of sorts there appears to be a long line of aliases for name posting over various websites and forums promoting himself and besmirching the characters of fellow climbers and related appears this is an attempt to use wikipedia to import offsite conflicts and further an adjenda it has been removed id suggest that name read the following wikipediawikipedia is in the real world and name my reply please remove hu12s libel and vandalism above and please report this users abuse to wikipedia administration also hu12 of the google results you searched most are in support of name with tons of his official summit photos on name adams hood shasta and listings of his timing officials you strangely give weight to the abusive chatsite gossip and unsupported libel and your own post above is of that nature chatsites with this sort of conduct are sad im reporting your libel and abuse to the wiki administrationsaffron1x talk note hu12 cites a link above as support for his allegations of name in reading the chatsite thread and note its a mere chatsite and has a lot of personal attacks gossip unfounded content libel etc you will nevertheless find considerable support for name including climbing record photos timing officials names etc hu12 emphasizes the allegations about the use of aliases and this is gossip and unsupported,0

further edits have persisted adding citation needed tags to the lede since the purpose of the lede is to summarise content in the body of the article which should be sourced wpcitelead does require editors to add redundant citations ie if the claim or fact is already sourced in the article the citation does not need to be provided again in the lead the first two sections of the article detail transcripts in which name proclaims himself to be vegetarian diary entries and witness testimony from people very well acquainted with his diet confirming that he was almost certianly vegetarian from onwards sources detailing his diet prior to the war are a bit more inconsistent indicating he may or may not have been vegetarian earlier in his life instead of repeatedly tagging the lead it would be helpful if the editor would at least explain their rationale for doing so if they feel the sentence does not adequately summarise the sourced content in the article then would they please explain exactky what their problem is with it please note if a problem does indeed exist with the sentence it is not that it is uncited it is that it does not neutrally and accurately summarize the claims our article makes tags only alert editors to a potential problem but if we do not understand what the problem is we cannot address it,0

latest edit i have amended a lot of the tabloid type rubbish information to reflect the true narrative of events not just as seen through the emotive myopic perspective of the hostile alien in question my edits paint the chinese as they truly are perceived and even quotes from chinese themselves in western and indonesian academic discourse unwanted unneeded unliked and willing greedy agents of their own demise my edits are the most thoroughly referenced and thus if any further edits are down unto this article it should be to remove anything aside from what i have included the chinese name songo fairytale has been disproven once and for all as a total lie disproven by archeological reality chinese did not bring islam and esepcially not to gresik also removed is poor quality sobstory emotive pov it was unreferenced and unsubstantiated and in some cases libelous,0

why didnt you block trusttruth and name sir your block of name is unfair apparently you didnt read the discussion the dispute was started by a nasty comment from trusttruth but you didnt block him then name was extremely nasty in a remark to mr tombe but you unfairly blocked mr tombe this indicates to me that he is right in what he says about you editors so unless you block the real offenders i have to assume that you sir are not a fair and honest person frankly sir i am upset by the way you have treated me here and this is not unusual editors treat users with disrespect as you have mr tombe wikipedia needs reform to create honest and accurate articles i dont see this happening all i see is political correctness and poorly written articles with significant political bias you need to block the real offenders in this controversy not mr tombe,0

name may meet the criteria but if he does there is no evidence of that in the article if he indeed does meet the criteria please add the evidence for this to the article while it is true that these are just guidelines and that exceptions may exist where the person is notable in spite of not meeting any criterion the case for notability nevertheless needs to be made i m not trying to prove that he isn t notable i m trying to determine if he is as far as i can see the criteria are not met the persons research has made significant impact in their scholarly discipline broadly construed as demonstrated by independent reliable sources i m not a fan of citation metrics and they re not the final word but the hindex is which is pretty average the most cited paper does have over citations but that s the moss genome sequence where he s one of many authors genome sequences always get lots of citations the person has received a highly prestigious academic award or honor at a national or international level this may be true but the article does not mention it i don t think a heisenberg fellowship counts as highly prestigious the person is or has been an elected member of a highly selective and prestigious scholarly society or association eg a national academy of sciences or the royal society or a fellow of a major scholarly society for which that is a highly selective honor eg the ieee again this may be true but isn t mentioned in the article the persons academic work has made a significant impact in the area of higher education affecting a substantial number of academic institutions no major textbooks or other examples of this are given in the article the person holds or has held a named chair appointment or distinguished professor appointment at a major institution of higher education and research no evidence for this is given in the article the person has held a major highestlevel elected or appointed academic post at a major academic institution or major academic society from what i can see in the article the highest position he has held was dean of the faculty of biology the person has made substantial impact outside academia in their academic capacity no evidence for this given in the article the person is or has been the head or chief editor of a major wellestablished academic journal in their subject area only normal editorial board memberships given in the article the person is in a field of literature eg writer or poet or the fine arts eg musician composer artist and meets the standards for notability in that art such as wpcreative or wpmusic does not apply if you can show that the criteria are met after all i m happy to go along with it but just being a professor does not satisfy wpprof cheers,0

wester civ hello i had gotten an email from one of western civs fans asking why they dont have a wikipedia page i remembered that there had been one at one point in time so i traced it back to you i am not an active wiki user so i do hope you forgive my lack of knowledge on how this works i have read the reason for deletion and i have also read all of the criteria that must be met by a band to be considered notable if i read the deletion log correctly i see that the reason for deletion was listed as expired prod borderline dbband that said i am including as references in this message links to their three published albums a list of press garnered and links to some of their fan pages online if you google the words western civ the band is the second and third return on google i do believe that these elements are all examples of notability as wikipedia defines it for music since the page western civ is simply being used to redirect people to the western culture article at the moment i do hope you will reestablish this page to its original form as a wiki for the band western civ references link to western civs published works link to western civs media press kit which includes of over published reviews and articles about western civ as well as a partial list of fm stations that are playing western civs music links to western civs websites please let me know where to go from here ill be looking forward to speaking with you further thank you manager western civ,0

it was not a personal attack but rather a racist remark about indians in general no i did not accuse anir1uph of being unfamiliar with the english language because he is indian his nationality was irrelevant anir1uph showed failure to use the english language correctly common practice among nonnative english speakers i am fed up with uneducated third world citizens who edit wikipedia according to their own pov anir1uph is a pretentious editor and forms fart of a larger indian demographic who subtly edit wikipedia pushing their own pov using weasel words and do not adhere to consensus there is a growing concern among a considerable number of white western editors that due to the increased availability of computers and the internet around the world the number of uneducated third world citizens with a pov agenda to their edits is rising rapidly nationalism is a large factor in this and it isnt healthy for the wikipedia community there is an ongoing clash of culture and outlooks asians view the world differently than europeans and north americans in my opinion the sooner editors are restricted to editing wikipedia in their native tongue the better i will hold my hands up for my disliking of india and the indian population i have a ferocious and bitter attitude towards them but not hatred i pity india and its misfortune children die every day in india under the age of how sad i find it amazing that inept little brown people can even use computers name me as a side note when a router is reset a new ip is given so even though i may not be able to edit from this user name whats stopping me from editing wikipedia if i create a new user even regional blocks dont work wikipedia needs to find real solutions to real problems name me,0

as daft as it sounds yes if it cant be verified it gets removed plain and simple i suggest you reread these core wikipedia policies wptruth wpverifable wpnamenor and wpnor i hav enot intentions in edit warring with you over it but be warned since it isnt sourced anyone can remove it and report you for vandelism talk contrib as it says on my talk page i prefer to have discussions all in the same place i am watching this page so please reply here to this end i have taken the liberty of moving your previous reply here so if i add a statement that there are no vacuum tubes in ssds either youll insist on a source for that too seriously you are mistaken on a few points i think you need to read wpverify yourself all material in wikipedia mainspace including everything in articles lists and captions must be verifiable all quotations and any material whose verifiability has been challenged or is likely to be challenged must include an inline citation that directly supports the material any material that needs a source but does not have one may be removed emphasis added jeh note the distinction you wrote if it cant be verified it gets removed but first the claim that ssds contain no disks obviously can be verified not only is it part of the definition of the term the very first reference in that very article confirms this claim in its description of these devices so no we dont need to cite a source for this particular instance of the claim and second except for blp issues wpv only states that unsourced material that needs a source may be removed this material didnt need a source and even if it did it isnt required to remove it right away even for claims that really should have a citation to a wprs the polite and widely accepted thing to do is to add a citation needed template see templatecn this is a much less abrasive thing to do to someones edit rather than simply reverting it i suppose you could say well since i removed it its verifiability has been challenged so now it does require a source yeah fine so i go to the work of adding a reference name to one of the refs thats already there and then cite that same ref from my new text as well no its not much work but consider does it really improve the article to add a reference footnote number to a statement that is as obviously true as this one is adding that little footnote number really the best use of my time here was it the best use of yours and will this little challenge you raised over a completely trivial edit and obvious claim make me feel more or less eager to contribute to wp in the future also in my edit i merely noted that despite the term solid state disk there are no actual disks inside these devices in your edit comment you said since they refer to it is a disk we must to sic well that is true but my edit did not remove any reference to the terms solid state disk or electronic disk from the article nor even claim that such were wrong so your edit comment was off point and provided no valid justification for your action finally i must point out that you are wrong about vandalism the fact is that edits made in good faith are not generally considered vandalism after reading wpverify you should probably look at wpvandalism even if misguided willfully against consensus or disruptive any goodfaith effort to improve the encyclopedia is not vandalism edit warring over content is not vandalism careful consideration may be required to differentiate between edits that are beneficial detrimental but wellintentioned and vandalizing mislabelling goodfaith edits as vandalism can be considered harmful emphasis added jeh you should probably also read wpagf to see what good faith means and what you are supposed to do about assuming it in sum please be careful about undoing others edits until you are more familiar with the actual prescriptions of things like wpverify consider using the cn template rather than reverting unsourced material please think carefully before tossing around words like vandalism and you should never have intentions of editwarring so the statement that you dont have any here is troubling why would you need to state such a thing if not for the possibility that you might have s,0
ive revised the translation from the spanish by going back to this earlier edit subsequent edits on the spanishlanguage wikipedia seem to have been intended mainly to insert links but have primarily succeeded in deleting chunks of the original text rendering the result both ungrammatical and somewhat insensible ive taken s translation and incorporated the previously omitted text and gone over the whole to make it more idiomatic in english its not quite there yet but is hopefully now serviceable,0
sure theyre subjective theyre rhetorical i was arguing a case i still think that the single arrival point article to which all others direct should be the most neutral i believe that that when dealing with periods in the past should be assumed to be the title used in the subjects own time necessarily adjusted for the english language in an e name encyclopedia here name the tetrarch the herod names have to be there because people will search for them these pages should note that there is disagreement about the use of the name and that there is very little firm evidence surviving from that time and then send the seeker to the historical name if someone with more knowledge than my own adds a note to the effect that theologians use and historians use that would be a welcome addition this means that all the terms would be in wikipedia they would all be findable and there would be a central page which would contain all relevant information and i trust everything that any user of an encyclopedia might want i dont want to move any pages just tidy up the way of finding them i dont think this is as strong an advice as you do more of a signpost perhaps a better image than guide in particular i was astonished when i began this by the confusion over hp i hp ii evidence for the elder name seems minimal,0
deleting and modifying reference an editor name sailor has been continously deleting and modifying references of the article just like a child playing with a toy just see the amount of manupulations he has done and after deleting references till now he is still continuing he claims that i am doing edit war he is the one vandalising the references and also voted for the articles removal clearly showing his intentions regarding the article i request the administors to take his vandalism seriously as he is using a loophole in the system by making small vandalising edits and also modifying such that if reverted the will accuse the reverting editor instead of the vandaliser like name sailor please do the needful request to all editors,0

issues onefortyone the reason why i removed your edits because they have following problems it is graceland that is 2nd most visited place in the usa not biltmore estate the d cor throughout the house has often been criticized is incorrect it has not been criticized by anyone then you put up the quotes of name a fringe theorist on name and added them under graceland which is irrelevant those conflicting reports about his death have no relevance on this article especially when they are disputed or rejected enough times this is why this kind of content misleads and should be removed i dont see any consensus for adding it on archives or previous discussion either,0
romanization for words of english origin on the mosjp talk page a discussion has been started about including or not including romanizations for words of english origin such as name in for the sake of simplicity i called this case words of english origin more information on semantics here over the course of a month it has become apparent that both the parties proposing to include or not include those romanizations cannot be convinced by the arguments or guidelines brought up by the other side therefore a compromise is trying to be found that will satisfy both parties one suggestion on a compromise has been given already but it has not found unanimous agreement so additional compromises are encouraged to be suggested one universally accepted point was to bring more users from the affected projects in to help achieve consensus and you were one of those selected in the process what this invitation is you should give feedback on the first suggested compromise and are highly encouraged to provide other solutions what this invitation is not this is not a vote on including or excluding such romanizations this is not a vote on compromises either it would be highly appreciated if you came over to the mosjp talk page and helped find a solution thank you in advance,0

the author of lotr clearly intended it to be a single book and it was sold as one concurrently with the threevolume editions as soon as it became popular enough to be economically feasible the utilitarian separation of the book into three volumes does not seem to me to be sufficient reason to declare it to be three separate books this is in stark contrast with rowlings books which have been published sequentially separated by years in between them and are considered by everyone including the author and publisher to be separate books entirely i agree that the individual books deserve a place on this list inasmuch as they merit one and that the series as a whole belongs on the series page i hope we can put this matter to rest now thank you for your time,0

august utc there is no wprs to affirm the veracity of dis doubtful claim either that is you have no wprs either way therefore it is not a verifiable fact that name or any of the other original signers consented to or agreed with the dis published interpretation or political position visavis pbs or any other subsequent political purpose regarding what should or shouldnt be taught in school all you have on verifiable record is that the original signers called for skeptical examination of the evidence for scientific theories dis unverifiable claim which fraudulently spins that into consensual agreement or support for their interpretation or political agenda is not a fact under the rules of wikipedia all the rest of dis propaganda is utter hogwash fraudulently perpetrated by the di without the verifiably demonstrated consent of the original individuals in view of the wpblp do no harm clause the unverified claim of the di must not be promoted to fact and any content to that effect must be immediately expunged per the wpblp,0

hello gerardw if you click on forsenas contribution list and review the edit summaries it is hard to believe that hes patiently seeking consensus on kosovo matters for instance removing data from albanian extermist vandal member name in particular look at this edit of battle of kosovo where forsena goes against all the cited references and actually removes most of them on the matter of disputed country versus disputed region if name continues to make that change without getting consensus first it would be worrisome though your point about the balkan topic ban is noted since forsena has not edited any articles since it was announced it is too soon to give him credit for following it the announcement that he was under name restrictions on january seems to have had no effect at all on his edits i will leave name a note that his editing was discussed here,0

tangential forces the tangential forces coriolis and name can be applied to a system but they dont occur naturally apart from perhaps in electromagnetism but that is off topic during the last week there was quite a bit of discussion going on about the name force and the oriolis force along with false allegations that i was confused between the two we can apply a coriolis force or an name force to a system if we like the name force will increase the angular acceleration and the coriolis force will change the direction of a constrained corotating radial motion in a rotating frame of reference with nonuniform angular acceleration there will be a fictitious name force acting tangentially in a keplerian orbit there will be zero tangential acceleration although it is possible to see that this zero is the sum of an ongoing equal and opposite name force and coriolis force having said all this tangential forces are not highly relevant to this article they could be mentioned in passing but the article is about a radial force the centrifugal force is an outward radial force more attempts should be made by the editors here to concentrate on differential equations in the radial distance variable they they might begin to get a feel for waht centrifugal force is all about,0

a poor start sorry the author seems to be totally mislead about both real history and the opinions on the table first of all no common twonations table is possible patent nonsense second i object the following the passage from the russian table speaking of the name as someone suggested earlier that table should by any mean include a disclaimer explaining very loose ancestry between name and modern russia this is the main disputed claim commented enough in other articles unacceptable for me and several other ukrainian and belarusian users regardless of any ukrainian military table none of them may include the red army this army was not only irrelevant to any of ukrainian states with very formal postwwii exception but also significantly antiukrainian for instance red army units widely participated in war crimes against ukrainian population and antisoviet guerillas creation of the ukrainian table here has been a mere discussion trick not supported by all ukrainian users for instance see earlier alexpus passage on trading the truth given all that id suggest you to delete your first draft and find other ways for compromising mrname i thank you an innocent editor for your valuable attempts and hope for further cooperation on the issue,0
i do know what the l in blp stands for and im happy that the equine project is staying on top of their blps but after sourcing and translating two articles for the equine project finding numerous factual errors and sourcing problems and then checking all of the same editors created articles versus the eswiki articles it appears that i made one mistake i guess the equine project wont be requesting my translating services again name talk,0

sigh i know how people want me to behave i cant be bothered anymore overt incivility is bad enough but the real problem here is the rude haughty sneaky incivility that people conceal with language that gives the appearance of civility when people come to my rfcs or talk threads and poison the well or simply accuse me of the very thing im trying to prevent what else is there really where else do i go from here people like name and name have already decided im a gravedancer and have repeatedly attacked me with that label with no evidence but werent blocked for any of it name was finally blocked for edit warring and i dont even know what name was blocked for long story short if people are going to pin labels on me and destroy my attempts at discussion with character assassinations whats the point whats the point of caring about wikipedia when the same characters keep poisoning the well all it does is make me defensive and want to fight this is the wikipedia that exists today,0

for the record i was serious about running in the rfa i was not trolling or disrupting i was advised that i should run in the rfa to see how it was like and i did so there should have been more questions during the rfa if there was any questions about sincerity the rfa was not a joke it was serious i feel i should have been made an name and then would have been the better example i felt that there was a possibility for confirmation and this should serve as example for other users to be afraid of self nominations to the rfa even when there is clearly a poll support for running in the rfa as i am truely afraid shocked and dismayed at the admins response as it seems now there is a new rule if the admin feel you are faking your rfa they can block you with zero assumptions of good faith,0
inventor or developer a recent addition was made to the article about a supposed early developer of the capsule endoscope it needed a reference so i reverted to an earlier version normally id add a citation tag but the editor himself made various claims about capsule endoscopy inventors and how he himself had a problem with mentions of such people without references i thought that was odd if there is a reference id be happy to add it but from my research there seems to be conflicts among many as to who first created it,0

minor wording issue about steamboats im doing some bits of minor copyediting and am stuck on this sentence from the navigation section the use of steamboats along the river beginning in there is a footnote to this timeline page which phrases it steamboats columbia and name begin regular service on the columbia river the thing is there were steamboats in regular service on the river before at least to fort vancouver the first was the name steamship which arrived at ft vancouver in i thought about rewording the sentence the regular use of steamboats along the river but that isnt quite right either because the name was in regular use even if its operations were not limited to the river anyway i cant come up with a way to reword this bit especially given the existence of the footnote which does not mention the name so im just mentioning it here it is a minor point to be sure but symptomatic of an unfortunate us bias present in many history books and web pages,0

ive traced the origin of one of the disputed sentences myself it seems the problem stems from multiple users whose first language is not english who dont understand the need for sources and who cant edit in accordance with wpnpov at july adds ishihara stated he respects the french culture but he just pointed out the problem of french language pov poor english unsourced and meaningless whats the problem with the french language that causes problems for mathematicians some of the worlds best mathematicians are french at august who seems to be french changes it to ishihara stated he respects the french culture but he just pointed out his ignorance about french mathematicians and his stupidity pov poor english unencyclopedic insulting unsourced at august changes it to ishihara then apologized by stating his apreciation for the french culture name and contains a spelling mistake possibly just a typo at august username reverts to ishihara stated he respects the french culture but he just pointed out his ignorance about french mathematicians and his stupidity see above perhaps the dispute between foc and name could be reduced if you were both to supply sources for every edit thats likely to be challenged also please bear in mind that this is the english wikipedia and edits must conform to a minimal standard of english this is especially true when the edits are contentious and are leading to weekslong edit wars im leaving this on focs page too talk august utc,0

dvd release regarding this section of the article this release is notable because due to marketing issues it was the first star wars film never to be released on vhs in the united states i think that this can be eliminated first of all this doesnt really make the release notable most films released at the same time were not released on vhs also the fact that it was released on vhs in other countries makes it even less notable it also does not have anything to do with the dvd release but rather the home video release,0

first off i am not inserting my personal point of view just the facts i dont know where you got your facts from but they are incorrect as a life long resident of name having both parents from name i am well aware of the boundaries of name and your account is false also i am not talking of this original town of name or is supposed boundaries but the name beach area today is made up of many neighborhoods to simply call name beach a neighborhood of name makes the very notion of name smaller than it really is i dont have agenda here i just dont want my home town slighted by misinformation it is the word neighborhood that is of issue name beach has several name it was settled almost years before name was established it is town that has been annexed it is not a neighborhood of name it existed before name these are historical facts is name under the municipal control of the city of name yesis it an area within the political boundaries of name yes is it part of name no,0
massacre i note that name massacre redirects to this page and that other similar massacres in history wherein government forces murdered civilians for protesting government policies are termed as such and such massacre there is no legitimate reason aside from sensitivity to extremist viewpoints in the united states to continue calling this article name shootings it should be changed to name massacre a cheap acknowledgement in the lead paragraph is insufficient i would appreciate discussion on this move and i will initiate the move myself soon enough,0

thankyou theindividualist and intangible duck talk nametyers moving my edit to another article that was real cute nametyers moving my edit to another article thereby getting it out of the way of this communistoanarchist article and taking credit for my research at the same time clever btw how many edits did you make on sunday the 23rd name let me countuh edits in one day you could get blocked for that if im not mistaken i may be wrong but i believe theres a wp3rr rule oh well happy editing duck talk,0

i strongly agree with lneal00 to keep those national statistics out because of completely varying methods used by different stat agencies in different countries the numbers must come from one organization claiming ab c is synthesis and is a direct violation of wpor however i agree with name that theres no problem with the ilo list its from the bbc and the ilo list should be in because the numbers are coming from one highly reliable organization if not the most reliable one so we are comparing apples to apples even if there are some flaws in that method that flaw as name suggested should be mentioned in the methodology but blanking out such a highly reliable source because of that is unacceptable and a serious violation of wpnpov we cant favor one source over the another,0
why even have the fucking talk pages if we cant comment on other users,1
first of all theres no need at all to apologise about discussing your dispute here secondly i think it would be a good idea or actually an essential step in solving the dispute to back off from this for a few days maybe even a week as youve been backandforthing for months already another week cant possibly hurt youll find that walking away and editing some articles unconnected with farming or with animal welfare will help put this whole hill of beans into its true perspective it will give us time to find other better or at least more widely acceptable images to use after i am ready i will start a new section in article talk where we can take this matter forward and arrive at a solution we can all live with how does that sound,0

disambiguation page does this need a disambiguation page i would argue that the other name is not prominent enough to cause confusion there is not even any article linked for him and the primrose article is pretty minor first i moved this to the bottom of the page because thats where people usually expect new material to be this way people looking will be more likely to see this question no biggie to answer your question no i dont think this really needs a disambiguation page for the same reasons that you listed,0

well there was a hot war going on in the background of tyold the konfrontasi the whole living dangerously line was based around sukarnos words ushering in of hot conflict against malaysia uk etc but on the point of indonesian civil war at least at the beginning of there was indeed some combat between the g30s forces and those loyal to name im of the opinion that the period of combat was brief and that after jakarta was seized by nasutionname loyalists the casualties were very lopsided hence why the pkis central committeein exile called it just a white terror but of course however the same group criticized aidit for not adhering to names peoples war doctrine so one could imagine that there were those sectors of the pki that were spoiling for a conflict hence i titled it indonesian civil war rather than indonesian white terror or indonesian coup it keeps things npov and open to different scholarly interpretations by i should point out that i have an interesting hard copy self critical document the pki central committee published from china detailing what they perceived as their mistakes in and attempts to reestablish the party unfortunately it is without copyright information printed this was likely due to attempts to get around import restrictions during the us cold war i am looking forward to contributing some choice quotes to round out indonesian civil war at any rate toodles,0

animation there is something very unique about south parkbecause of the style of animation it is actually possible to have an episode of south park in an svg animation which is a file format that allows for unlimited upconversion of images and animation but only in a way of simple shapesand since south park is already a somewhat brick style animation you could theoretically upconvert it to high definition using the svg format and it would look just like that was the normal resolution,0

suggestions to improve readability hi guys the page seems very fragmented and is difficult to read at least thats what i read in the reader comments i inserted public ledger in the first sentence because it was missing before delving into the supertechnical aspect of how bitcoins are generated and frustrate readers i d start from the spot that everybody understands about money explain the intent of the system missing right now sthg like it was created to exchange money electronically and securely without a third party that can dictate credit worthiness or price of transactions as in banks or paypal etc then move on to basics keep the bitcoin protocol details out of the article since you already split off the page about the protocol the shortest description ive read is when a transaction is broadcast to the network it is relayed with a digital fingerprint that identifies it name miners scoop it up verify it and send it on to the rest of the network for confirmation once the transaction has been confirmed there is no way for that same person to spend those same bitcoins because they are being checked against the public ledger by name in ieee spectrum feb a short and successful article explaining bitcoins is here another faq from a washington post blog is here and an article days ago about the death of the mt gox name exchange by name was on science friday today is here name was also discussed on point last november in conjunction with the senate committee hearing about it,0
ahh name symbols name characters i greek cyrillic ipa t d my famous article witze happiness wikipedia the name is a great honour that has been passed down through the generations of many families regardless of race age character or knowledge the outside world knows little about these elusive characters and the honour of the name for those who have ever been a name it has been said to have been a great honour although the qualities needed for the job have never been disclosed a person may not now they were a name for many years until they are called by former names via dreams associates of the name are known to be a certain babe cool or the much lesser known name the present name is an yearold boy namely name who is said to have become a name after he felt this awesome radiance in his topright bumcheek he has not told a great number of people his testimony but has promised to do so in years to come history the present world has only come enlightned with the knowledge of the name in present years because former witzemen have not been so public about the honour to abide with the formality and conservativism in their time the term name is a compound word of the adjective witze and man witze being an 11th century term for a person of extreme humour and radiant intelligence unfortuneatly witze is also sometimes associated with bad wind for unspeakable reasons proper history as early as the 14th century witzemen were considered outcasts and young children were encouraged to poke them with sticks this led to the 1st name rebellion of when the current name and his followers attempted a coup to take over the local council chess team this rebellion further disgraced the name as he and his followers were embarassingly pronounced gaga at a government meeting that year the period from here to the early 1900s was a dark time in the names history however good times were to come for the name many normal people took part in mass demonstrations and protests for the name in the 1980s building up to a great moment in the historythe great rebellion of this was when several name sprinted round the visitors gallery of the house of commons wearing clown masks but otherwise completely naked this was thought to be an act of circambulation however many people who witnessed this shocking behaviour were mentally spiritually and emotionallly scarred for life this group of people included many young children who were forced to go to asylums in a state of mental instability suffering from trauma it was at this time that the government finally took positive action for the name in a bill of rights for the name was signed stating all witzemen were allowed to do as they pleased although this was a formal agreement many journalists viewed it as a letter of submission from the government to the name as the behaviour of the name and his followers became more and more twisted,0

rename aussie film list index sorry im on the fence with that one index and resources kind of longwinded to me difficult to get to easily without redirection but i completely agree with you as to what the page is its partly disambiguation and not useful for much else except for the links maybe also although controversial as to what to list the page could summarise the influential films for that country in a concise list of around top films of notability or really made an impact on culture but then i guess thats what the cinema of australia article is for yeah im not sure about that particular title but i think it might be better to steer it into something maybe it should just be a disambiguation page and the links and resources might be better suited on the cinema of australia page,0

hi again dear yes i strongly support independence of south name from iran if green movement could change somethings probably i would change my idea but i dont want to be under islamic rejim anymore and i support the changing of destiny of namei people and about nameis are names or not despite you are talking about persian theory of the roots of nameish people we all know that names started to migrate here circa ad when saljuk names of west branchoghuzstarted to come but infact it is not important when they came here the important thing is every one in name feel themselves as namei and not name which is an invented word by persians names and believe that they r names and speak nameish lang as same as names of nameey you can come here and ask yourself one by one you will see it is so irrarational to say to some one that no you r not name you dont know who you are i know you r name and names are indoeuropean pls dont tell us who we r let us to identify ourselves and we identify ourselves as a name whatever others like or not about name as i know we didnt have eyalat name in the qajar era we had eyalat azarbaijan and both name rep and name was part of this big eyalat as well as south name name was part of this big land but the important thing is the name of land is not important here as well the important thing is the people who live in name rep former name as you called are of my race and we r same nation you may call there name or name but the important thing is here a nation live which called themselves namei names you may call them whatever you want as well as their land the important thing is what they call themselves if they change the name of their republic will you satisfy what about next will you ask them to call themselves namei and start to speak nameian language which does not exist ok lets think nameis r not name so what they r name ok lets call them name what is the next step you will ask them to forget to speak in nameish language and start to speak persian or not speak name lang so what is name lang where is it can you learn it to about million people lets thing pragmatic as well as rational even if your theory of roots of this people is correct historically you cant ask them to speak neither a lang of years ago nor persian also i dont rely neither to researches of kasravi nor zehtabi cos both were under some believes of their backgrounds and governments one was paniranist other was panturkist some of their researches looks really funny about the names of nameish places and cities i guess you have never ever travell to name if you were here youll see that iranian government has changed the names during pahlavi era some of them are such a funny thing that r jokes between us for example name has a suburb in western part of the city called akhmagaya which in nameish means the rock which falling down and it is a rocky place do u know what is its official name ahmagiyyeh the lands of stupid people all of the nameish names tried to change to a persian words which looks verbally simmilar them the fact is persian never have been to name most of the namei names have namen or tat roots not persian my believe is that a mixture of differnet natios like tats namens and other caucasian tribes lived here and then nameish tribes of western branch have migrated to this land in large size and get married with the native people and has made the new nation which called namei names nowadays they have their own culture music dance cuisine etc which seperate them form persians and interestingly this culture is like culture of names of anatolia which believes that they r percent name i told you history is not important than today the important thing is every one here feel themselves as a name i dont know what they want us to feel in tehran the name of azar abade gan looks wrong as well this word cant change to azarbaijan during history i guess the word was azar pay gan maybe which zoroastrian persians called not azar abad gan which name mentioned in shahnameh and everyone got to accept it now i had a look to your files about vote frauding which i still believe is correct as well the diagrams of those pdf pages show that people of iran will give their votes to name when that company asked them before election but you know there is unwrittenable rules in iran which every one know whenever some one come and ask me in person that do u like islamic republic name and name i will answer yes cos i dont want to lose my life we dont have life guaranty,0

ivo nameaca bit of nonteleological history one of the great problems is that our understanding of the common and individual histories of the south slavs and the other peoples of southeastern europe has not significantly benefited from critical historiography this is because nationalist historiographies regularly have explained modern developments as an aspect of unilinear design we have been taught to see connections that may be of our own making for example if we look at a current political map of the area and compare it to that from the era of settlements we will see that the present political divisions do not correspond to those from the early medieval period nameia is mainly a coastal area from the rasa river in istria to the cetina river a little bit to the east of the city of split down the coast from the original nameia we have a row of unfamiliar slavic territories that constantine vii porphyrogenitus the tenthcentury byzantine emperorhistorian called pagania literally land of the pagans name most of presentday eastern herzegovina with the nameian peninsula of peljesac terbounia the trebinje area of eastern herzegovina with name and its eastern coastal environs and name the southern portions of contemporary montenegro with the bay of kotor and the northwesternmost portions of presentday albania around lake skadarshkoder serbia is located in the hinterland of name terbounia and name its center around ras near todays novi pazar in the sandzak bosnia was apparently within this territory but represented a negligible area around the source of the bosna river where we now find sarajevo and its environs and name in the tenthcentury this was a necklace of byzantineruled roman coastal cities and island territories from krk in the north to ulcinj in the south moreover modern territoriality required a tradition that was itself a product of modernity thus unrelated traditions were merged to produce an idea of ethnicas opposed to culturalcontinuity the name historical tradition goes back to the chronicle of the priest of name a twelfthcentury text from bar in contemporary montenegro and its various translations for example name which were in turn incorporated into the early modern slavic and namen histories of mavro orbin and name name these works then became material for the nameianizing work of pavao ritter vitezovic nameia rediviva who was the most important influence on the revivalist generation of name and that of postrevival integral nationalists like name curiously the same histories orbins were serbianized through the translations of name which then influenced the pioneering serbian histories of name and were bulgarianized in the history of name the bosnian historical tradition was somewhat more selfcontained it combined the franciscan memory of medieval bosnian statehood with the experiences of muslim ayan notable selfrule to argue for a uninational bosnia for example name whose book was published between and clearly something has happened in the span of ten centuries pagania name and terbounia have disappeared the center of nameia has migrated from the adriatic to the north into medieval slavonia literally slavic land with zagreb at its head this happened in stages during the high middle ages the heart of nameia was on the una river now in northwestern bosnia this territory turkish nameia was lost to the ottomans in the sixteenth century and became a part of bosnia during the habsburg reconquest and the concomitant venetian operations in the seventeenth century the framework of modern nameia emerged in two extended shanksone to the north to modern slavonia the other in the south in modern name at the same time the zagreb area which was only dubiously nameian in the early middle ages became the heart of modern nameia the story of serbia is not much different serbia first migrated to the coast and assimilated name then it moved to the ibarmorava valleys then toward the valleys of struma and vardar in macedonia it reached the name only as an ottoman vassal in the fifteenth century and its modern capital belgrade became truly serbian only in the course of names uprising in bosnia too expanded under name or prorex kulin r into the donji kraji literally lower lands around the vrbas river and the name literally name for centuries ottoman then modern tuzla and name in its present northeastern corner later on at the height of its power in fourteenth century bosnia expanded into hum herzegovina and the drina river valley the westernmost regions were inc,0

criticism the oohashi et al results reveal some interesting contradictions while full bandwidth sound was preferred to cd limited bandwidth over a speaker the test for the ultrasonic music band was inaudible when reproduced alone additionally the preference for hfc was not replicated when using headphones only with speaker presentation ruling out the ear as the means by which the effect was produced these are not contradictions they are an essential feature of the study specified and discussed in the paper there is no contradiction here out it goes contrary evidence and abx tests oohashi et al pictured human brains when the test persons were either exposed or not exposed to ultrasonic stimulus abx tests only tell what differences test persons consciously perceive or not during the test if same research methods had been used and results were drastically different that should be called contradictory i will state that even more generally than previous there are certainly many signals and irritants that human beings can be unconsciously exposed to but nevertheless they affect humans wellbeing and happiness for example several chemicals or radioactivity would do that we just dont know the whole truth about ultrasonic signals yet some signals could be processed half consciously in humans brains one feels restless or nervous but still does not know why,0

name name is a fictional character not a real person and as such the qualifications are very much irrelevant to the article the article name including qualifications although notice none of the other articles on eastenders doctors list them is also irrelevant secondly she has only been referred to as name on few occasions she is not credited as name in anyway however in the case of other characters such as name it is different she was referred to on a much wider scale as name but her credited name is still nameissa,0
it doesnt seem to me that your wikipedia history is a particularly good one you own wikipedia page shows evidence of potentially hundreds of agravated users i think what you are trying to say is that in years you have never been caught outright and had your account banned i would say given your behaviour here and your past history shown by your own personal page is that it is likely is that you have borderline trolled for a number of years but that is just to say that your history contradicts what you say ive been quite clear about this right at the start and ive let you know as soon as i felt you were crossing the line at this stage i warned you and pointed you to wikepedia guideline on trolling the specific policy you may be in breach of is vandalism i am alleging that your behaviour amounts to trolling you are threatening in effect to vandalize my work what you are trying to do is in effect bully me to change my work to fit your personal pov that is plainly a breach of wikipedia policy and guidelines if you think im somehow getting it wrong and your behaviour is perfectly innocent then by all means go to those sources you yourself suggest if you come back with a clean bill of health then i am prepared to revise my view if you get a reliable source to review your posts here and they give their expert view that i am wrong then im quite happy to remove the allegation with respect to the citations i am the author and so if you are unhappy with the sources ive used and having brought it to my attention but failing to find agreement after having discussed the matter it is up to you to consult a reliable source who is prepared to support your position something ive suggested now a number of times otherwise we will keep the article as it is particularly as it has been alleged that you are trolling an allegation which it appears you do not dispute discussing a variety of possiblities does not actually address the allegation particularly its important that you refrain from making any changes until the allegation has been cleared up if you dont i intend to follow the wikipedia guidelines on how to deal with vandalism caused by trolls,0

calling it the white stolen generation doesnt exclude aboriginals from being recognized on the contrary it is the other way around for example when the apology to the stolen generations was made was there any reference to white mothers or children no there wasnt only aboriginals and tsi were recognized thus this is why the term white stolen generation was created to help distinguish it even aboriginals recognize the white stolen generation by the following after the apology to the stolen generation indigenous leader name an elder of the name people helped bring it out last november when he wrote i applaud the prime minister s apology to our mob but what about the white stolen generation that suffered the same fate i know many white people who went through the same pain so why can t this government do its healing again and apologise to the white stolen generation to bring closure to all this suffering,0

wikipediarequestsforcommenthistoryandgeography the following rfc was posted earlier today in order to end this dispute once and for all i trust that you will do the same name talkrossville staten island as part of an ongoing edit war has been arbitrarily reverting all additions of external links to the article as removal of spam these external links which had been part of the article since its creation are not spam and were unjustifiably removed one external link links to an article about the 150th anniversary of the oldest roman catholic church in staten island which is located in the neighborhood another external link links to a website created by a former resident who describes what it was like to grow up in the area before it was built up it seems to me that this nameip name character who has recently been resoundingly rejected in his candidacy for name is not making legitimate revisions based on the rules of wikipedia but on his own interpretation of what is spam id like to request that this article be submitted for third party arbitration and i have exhausted all attempts at a compromise with mr name i will abide by any decision made by an impartial administrator concerning this dispute thank you very much for your consideration,0

basic income dispute resolution i dont understand the finding futile or how to proceed to resolve the issue regarding the wikipediabicyclesandwagons reference its my understanding that i am building a bicycle that may be slightly off spec and the editors are ordering the steel melted and shipped to hell instead of allowing the bicycle to be refined into spec i point out also that the basic income is listed as a priority by four wikigroups and so it is a pretty important bicycle also the nature of basic income is at a theoretical philosophy stage and the highest quality references possible are available to verify and preferably succinct and high quality blogs provide the best verifiability imo but regardless of this opinion a section on proposed benefits does not need prestigious academic references if the claim being made is that the ideas and rationale has merely been proposed to keep the bicycleswagons analogy the page was a high quality bicycle and an important bicycle to wikigroups there is a difference of opinion over whether the bicycle meets specs but it is a functional bicycle that is more useful than a pile of melted metal shipped far away,0

i feel like i cant improve upon this interaction while not understanding from the people involved the person i said it to and who did the block hours after the conversation was over if as said that blocks are meant to be preventative not punitive then i think its fair for me to ask questions about it to see where the situation went wrong when i posted that message and i still havent heard from the block admin that its content was the issue i thought i was making an attempt to improve upon the interaction with this editor by trying to speak with him on a sincere and personal human to human level and made the comment on his user page in order to make contact with the person rather than having us both resort to the standard drawnout wikiprocedures so far at least onwiki that editor has had no reaction to what i said while people visiting my page here after the block have had incredibly intense reactions i just have to ask if its fair that i be punished so intensely for their reactions to what i said especially when there is a power disparity with them able to block based on their reactions and me only able to appeal on this page,0

socialistm there are two important features of names concept of the invisible hand first name was not advocating a social policy that people should act in their own self interest but rather was describing an observed economic reality that people do act in their own interest second name was not claiming that all selfinterest has beneficial effects on the community he did not argue that selfinterest is always good he merely argued against the view that selfinterest is necessarily bad it is worth noting that upon his death name left much of his personal wealth to charity good lets all make sure we put forth the idea that adam name was a socialist thats the wikipedia way,0

locations thailand while phuket is a more popular and well known general tourist location in thailand that includes sex tourism pattaya is clearly a location that is dedicated almost exclusively to sex tourism i dont know phuket that well but well enough it is bigger but probably has alot more nonsex tourists so if i were going to identify a place in thailand if not the world i would mention pattaya instead and i am tempted to edit i hazard a good guess that on any day there is much more sex for money going on in pattaya than phuket but for someone considering the phrase sex tourism as not necessarily pejorative i have to qualify this conclusion note that bar girls in thailand never refer to themselves as prostitutes and this probably goes for most of the general thai population also although i beleive that there are words in thai for prostitute they mostly at least the girls prefer to call themselves rented wifes albeit for short time rather then long time i therefore need to be qualify my pattaya versus phuket statistic in order to be accurate as excluding sex between husbands and rented wifes particularly of the longterm married western kind that typically eventually end up with a large exchange of capital in the wifes direction whether during the marriage or at its end or both there is no such thing as a free lunch and everybody pays for it note that i neither intend nor consider any of the former comments to be either sexist note women still get paid less than men and suffer loss of income during pregnancy and child rearing and moreover consider them culturally aware particurlay thailand wise the fact is that almost all relationships of a sexual kind are commercial ones one must be aware that labels concepts ideas such as sex tourism carry suggestions associated with religion particularly name jdi pejoratives thst underpin much of western if not most of the religious worlds worldviews outside of some tribal village usually buddhist and what i like to call giesha cultures eg japan thailand etc versus virgin cultures typically jdi that often revolve around even int he west to some extend the worhship and praise of female virginity before marriage note that thai society is strangely contradictory in this regard arent we all but then thai culture too has a long and more recent tradition of polygamy than the west perhaps some historioreligious criticism of these sorts o pejorative and cultural factors should be entertained in the article proper also i hate value laden western and religious labels that dress themselves up psuedoscientificly as culturally universal exploitation of the child aside their is vastly more exploitation going on outside of the sex busniess in the third world under global capitalism like chinese factories where labourers girls included work excruciating long hours for a few yuan or rmb,0

pope name article quote from jerusalem post editorial hi herzen wanted to make sure you saw that i reverted an edit you made on the pope name article asking that the issue be discussed on the talk page i did change the sentence you had deleted to reflect the fact that it came from an editorial not an article in the jerusalem post sorry for my mistake guess it was my sloppy thinking just categorizing editorials and news articles as different types of articles however i think its a really wonderful quote only positive the jerusalem post is a highly respected paper representing the views of an important segment of the jewish community those who live in israel if we talk about relations between this pope and the jewish community i think its great to have a quote from a paper like that basically saying that this pope has been in a place that gave him a chance to have a rich relationship with the jewish community perhaps richer than any previous pope anyway i think its a very good quote in a section that addresses the popes prior relationship with the jewish community i hope youll reconsider your objection in the meantime i have asked for the opinion of other editors hope we can all agree best wishes and thanks for all your good work on this article,0

your suggestion of editing the article is completely workable and was working as per wikipedia guidelines until name and slimvirgin started deleting large relevant chunks of the article and reverting it to what we have now as punitive gestures if we can all agree to concentrate on making the article better instead of punishing each other there is no reason the article has to be locked i agree that we should start with an extremely innocuous definition preamble statement we can all agree on however a definition doesnt do anyone any good unless it conveys some sort of information if there were just one word that we could all agree is associated with terrorism that would be better than no definition at all intimidate for instance,0

moncrief do you even know what a shepherd is i used to work on a cattle ranch so i know a bit about this stuff to quote the wikipedia article on shepherds a shepherd is one who takes care of sheep usually in flocks in the fields unlike farmers shepherds were often wage earners being paid to watch the sheep of others the 1960s werent biblical times shepherding had long since become one of those crappy jobs that downandout laborers got when they could get it in fact thats an important part of proulxs story characterizing them as a particular kind of wretched of the earth calling them cowboys is yet another example of arrogant coastal ignorance i am more sensitive to the argument that they only worked on the sheep operation that one summer afterwards ennis worked with cattle and name worked most of his life in an office job not as a rodeo cowboy to whoever made that remark however the bulk of the movie painstakingly details that crucial first summer the summer that so defined them therefore id say that the relevant description especially in this paragraph discussing that summer would be shepherds that however is more up for debate i would settle for calling them laborers who got jobs herding sheep although anybody whos ever worked on a ranch or knows a damn thing about ranching knows that thats just a circumlocution for shepherd but since i dont want to make a personal hobby of constantly changing this page ill settle for that as a compromise name,0

name i am sorry for your desperation ill refrain from skepticism but it is both misguided and misplaced the issue is far wider than a dialog with name interests it is a a dialog with russoskeptic interests and since mauco has branded me a partisan ill identify that as my partisanship i do not see this as an ethnic struggle for selfdetermination of ukranians and russians from moldovans i see it as a naked russian power play and not the only such one currently to gain economic advantage and energy advantage it can use as a lever and territorial buffer advantage against nato expansion regarding the will of the people and dancing with joy in the streets no impartial observer and certainly no russoskeptic will regard those as true expressions until such time as minimally the authorities from the top to the bottom are replaced with transnistrian natives not populated by russian citizens including omon thugs who transplanted to transnistria once their attempts at thwarting true democracy in the baltics by violent and deadly means failed and russia and ukranian forces completely vacate the transnistrian territory that is all arms all troops and raze all arms depots to the ground when that happens and people then dance in the streets then i will be prepared to initiate a discussion with you about that expression being genuine you keep talking about the parliaments opposition to smirnov as a russoskeptic i will tell you that my interpretation is not popular representation in action my interpretation is a bunch of initially hastily organized parties which all suddenly appeared right before some elections which are now engaged with the leadership which has not changed since its inception in a carefully orchestrated ballet intended to present a fully believable facsimile of representative government we can seriously discuss the will of the people after every russian in the pmr authorities is out as in out and out of the country after the foreign troops are all out as in out of the country and their arms depots demolishedand i dont mean russian military retiring to become citizens of the pmr either after it is legal for a political party to be name that currently being treason and after romanian is once again taught in its proper latin script not in some cyrillic sovietera utter bastardization created purely to support the stalinist fiction that moldovans are not romanians then we can seriously discuss the validity of your interpretation i have the patience to wait for that discussion do you if the russoskeptics disagree with anything ive represented please feel free to correct,0

thanks to all for taking my rather offhand comment seriously to reiterate my original explanatoin to name im interested in this more on a meta level how do we approach controversial subjects than out of deep feelings one way or the other towards name and his film that is im trying to see the forest of making a good article on the film rather than the trees of every factual detail within the film that contributors might have multiple viewpoints about for an encyclopedia based around the concept of a neutral point of view any attempt to either counter or defend the content of a subject that is in itself an editorial statment seems wrong such discussions wind up as parasites draining the life and meaning out of an otherwise useful article see for example something like roe v wade theres no need to use that article to debate all the pros and cons of the subject involved there are other articles for that linked at the bottom just state the facts about the case even if you really consider names movie to be completely indefinsible propaganda and to risk the wikiequivalent of names name here note that the article on triumph of the will doesnt feel the need to explain all the reasons why nazi germany wasnt all it was cracked up to be similarly shouldnt we just describe the content of the movie noting that it is controversial and then if we want an article about the name family departure or whatever we can put the facts about that subject there jul utc,0

oppose all i was going to support things until i read names statement we should put the eu second because of its unique position in international relations and because we should focus on the country with which its relating meanwhile we also shouldnt have country after georgia because this is a situation in which its unambiguous us states arent able to have foreign relations so the only time when georgia could have foreign relations was before the united states existed and there wasnt an eu at that time note that we have many other articles in which the disambiguator isnt present because of the context list of governors of georgia and president of georgia are undisambiguated because the country has no governor and the state has no president national register of historic places listings in georgia is undisambiguated because the us governments historic preservation program doesnt include places in the caucasus and coast guard of georgia is undisambiguated because the state doesnt have its own coast guard,0

perhaps you could comment on the substantive issue the sourcing of large chunks of the article to material hosted on unofficial websites we have no way whatsoever of ascertaining whether they are genuine and true copies and there has been no evidence whatsoever out forward to verify that they have been published at all contrary to annertowns claims not all us government material is available under the foia there are explicit exceptions for some material relating to law enforcement for example and it is anything but selfevident that material only obtainable under the foia would meet wikipedias criteria as published at all,0

the sims expansion and stuff packs listing together since the good article review suggested that the sims expansion packs and stuff packs be on its own listing my question is this if we decide to split the sims games ie core game with expansion and stuff packs onto one listing should we remove the sims stuff packs article and merge it into a new article with core expansion pack stuff pack article listing i think the core expansion pack stuff pack article is wise and thus eliminating the stuff pack article in my honest opinion because we dont need two lists of stuff packs so this is a public vote and note the good article review is in the archive article page see archive list above for link sundogs talk page sandbox,0

consider whether the details about the visual identity are relevant in an encyclopedic article about the museum in general if you think they are too specific you can also consider adding parts of it to the articles of the designers instead the articles should be sourced differently this article is not published by the stedelijk museum amsterdam so the reference should look something like this name wim crouwel in conversation confessions of a design geek retrieved on and finally note that wikipedia is a work in progress so your paragraph doesnt need to be perfect before it can be added to the article succes with your project,0

i cant quite figure it out the system of numbering dynasties was developed by manetho in the thirtieth dynasty so it isnt often applied to later dynasties but it looks like the second period of achamenid rule following the thirtieth dynasty is sometimes called the thirtyfirst dynasty one might count the ptolemies as the thirtysecond dynasty but i dont know if any reliable sources do so theyre either called the ptolemaic dynasty or the ptolemies or the lagides and counting them as number instead of would ignore the argead dynasty alexander the great his son name of macedon and name which ruled briefly but probably as long as some of the minor numbered dynasties i cant see any reason for counting the ptolemies as number unless sources address the issue i think attempts to give the ptolemies a number should be left out of the article,0

yahel your edit was not legit in that your pov and bias is displayed so blatantly through your edits it is clear that you do not have the ability to constructively edit these various race articles now no longstanding editor but me seems to be disputing it on that page so i think i have a consensus for my edit you do not have consensus i a longstanding editor not that my time here is relevant am disputing your edit there is a lengthy consensus on the talk page of the article which specifically addresses this very change youre making so in that you are editing against the established consensus considering consensus can change you need to discuss your thoughts on the talk page in order to attempt to achieve that merely making the change against consensus and hoping no one notices or bothers to comment is not acceptable additionally your edit in this article and your edit on white supremacy are contradictory to one another both are racist ideologies and both should word it as such love,0

request to unblock i began writing the following statement excepting its two postscripts before i was blocked i suspect that user auburnpilot had me blocked in order to prevent me from complaining to administrators about his misconduct although i was directed to request an unblock of user physicq210 who had blocked me requesting such of the latter would require that i censor myself and write as though user physicq210 had acted in good faith and was one of the good guys that would be surreal and would give user physicq210 a moral legitimacy belied by his actions and so the following request for unblocking is directed at any administrator but user physicq210 but since i m not a devious sort i have nothing against the latter reading this indeed i want user physicq210 to read it for if i can be banned from wikipedia for standing up to censors then it is vastly preferable to go down fighting than to go down the long dark road of selfabnegation and selfcensorship including the use of bad english after all if i wanted to be a lackey i could go to graduate school wiki administrators notice board incidents user auburnpilot a few days ago user auburnpilot began stalking me checking wherever i had made edits and going to the articles in question and vandalizing them he or she has been manipulating wikipedia rules as cover for what is clearly political censorship user auburnpilot cannot even stand for wikipedia readers to find out about factual material that upsets his political applecart through footnotes zero tolerance he claims of any source he politically dislikes that it is either spam or a blog or pov another favorite dodge for those at wikipedia seeking to censor those who fail to conform to their own pov even though the one source is a previously published classic magazine article otherwise unavailable on the web which the author has seen fit to publish on his web site and the other source is the longest most thorough expos yet published on the duke rape hoax note that i am not even talking about censoring writing within articles since i hadn t done any writing on the articles in question crystal name name duke university lacrosse team scandal and racial profiling i ve been involved in edit wars before though i have never been the aggressor and have never initiated an elective edit war though given the selfassurance that aggressors such as user auburnpilot exude perhaps i ought to reconsider that position it seems that aggressors rule here the reason i am making a formal complaint is that user auburnpilot has tonight upped the ante threatening to have me banned if i do not surrender to his censorship should you find for me please serve this individual with the wikiquivalent of a ceaseanddesist order should you however find for the censor please provide an index of banned publications and a list of official wikicensors ps january 115a est since beginning this complaint i see that user auburnpilot has in fact succeeded at getting a crony user physicq210 to block me thus not only getting administrative support in censoring me but preventing me from responding to his thuggery and no i am not going to use cutesy euphemistic language if i were into such deception i would have become a liar er lawyer and would be worthless as an encyclopedist and i was unable to email user physicq210 because i am not logged in and you must be logged in and have a valid authenticated email address in your preferences to send email to other users if this isn t cyberstalinism i don t know what is so let me get this straight stalking and censoring an editor while using the equivalent of smiley faces user auburnpilot s penchant for saying thank you after vandalizing one s links is civil but complaining about such abuse counts as spam disruption incivility and personal attacks if that is verily so then pps the message here says that i was temporarily blocked from editing wikipedia as a result of your disruptive edits what the heck is that supposed to mean for restoring footnotes and links that user auburnpilot had vandalized if that constitutes disruptive edits then you ve utterly given up on honest english and all human decency sorry but i don t have any sympathy for the devil,1

viriik so vote on a consensus on a questionable and corporate watchdog site the problem is that you are giving more validity to a person managed website that is hardly corroborated than a credible site like global security federation of american scientists cnbc yahoo that website does not belong on the site i would accept controversy but the problem is that it needs to be corroborated you cant put a website that accuse name of a secret plot against the president based on a site like rense for example you want to support lunancy this isnt your soapbox to do so,0

your report thank you for making a report on wikipediaadministrator intervention against vandalism reporting and removing vandalism is vital to the functioning of wikipedia and all users are encouraged to revert warn and report vandalism however administrators are generally only able to block users if they have received a recent final warning one that mentions that the user may be blocked and they have recently vandalized after that warning was given the reported user has not yet been blocked because it appears this has not occurred yet if this user continues to vandalize even after their final warning please report them to the aiv noticeboard again thank you talk,0

discussion is a twoway street wheres the wikipedia editorstaff contribution to the discussion on the justin name talk page why are all the questions from my side of the argument being ignored why has no one yet managed to justify the removal of any of the thoroughlydocumented information from the justin name page im not trying to throw gasoline onto a fire here i dont have an agenda and im honestly not particularly interested in mr name or his sordid history what i am interested in is seeing wikipedia be an respected and accurate source of free information for those who seek it and when the wikipedia staff themselves engage in an organised effort to remove accurate information with no justification whatsoever we normally call this wikipediavandalismvandalism wikipedias credibility goes out the window justify yourselfs and maybe well start to listen my side has justified itself repeatedly its your turn now,0

thanks for the speedy reply and the links after mining through about or thirty none seem to indicate a clear consensus on the issue of what is or is not a minor edit there are some agreement regarding specific examples where the edits being made where disagreed upon such as template redirects or date delinking but not much outside that clearly agreeing an edit as minor as i mentioned before i still think that someone needs to establish clearly what is considered a minor edit perhaps in a table form that can be added too or removed as needed rather than a vague catch all description for example after reading the many of the discussions i can see that there does seem to be agreement that removing blank spaces or changes to casing are minor and shouldnt be done alone aside from those the rest where argued both ways and it appears that the more technical users won the arguments by force of will and access rights im not trying to beat a dead horse here but i just wanted to point out that the example you gave didnt really emphasize what you were trying to convey and if anything supporterted the opposition if they had bothered to read it,0

if you want to claim pov good faith obliges you to specify your claims on the discussion pages for the article im afraid you arent going to substantiate these changes by claiming that adl and lipstadt are inherently pov nor are you going to succeed in claiming that it is inherently pov to say name was discredited you have contributed nothing to the discussion on the article and cannot expect a great deal of credibility without making arguments on the discussion pages to back edits that are contrary to evident consensus apparent on the discussion pages,0

please take a break i have been reading this snafu you are doing yourself no favors please take a break i just want to work on improving and creating articles etc yes defending myself is a laborious activity but to hear exaggerations and hypocrisy thrown at me in an effort to demonize me for expulsion to protect the encyclopedia is hard to stay away from the overall nature of said activity is wpbaiting and things like the cfd and the hostile rm closures is agfnpa in the extreme who should take a break is the choruscadre whose primary activity on wikipedia seems to be attacking contributing editors by any specious and povagf rationale available i know im not alone in being attacked and vilified this way and yes theres far more productive things to be doing than arguing with people who only want to argue,0
whoever wrote the plot i feel terrible for whoever had to watch the movie in detail and then write the plot line who ever took their time to write the plot section must be traumatized for life however its missing the part where milos son is laying on his belly unconscious on a bed milo anally rapes him while several masked men watch also theres some use of a knifesword in this scene this is truly one sick film no there is no artistic message this film is basicly a middle finger by the sickminded film makers the cast must have been tricked into participating in this disgusting film theres artistic gore such as the classic film name and then theres this listen to me dont watch this film no matter how much you are tempted,0

regarding any unix implementation of tmpfile is probably reentrant that was just a hunch as i admittedly dont know enough about unix to say that with confidence and precisely for this reason i did not say that in the main article if you see that conversation i was justifying why i wrote in the article that gnu tmpfile is reentrant which is obviously too systemspecific it was precisely because i dont know if other implementations are reentrant and the only objective thing i can say is that gnu tmpfile is reentrant,0
my actions are not disruptive why youre saying this is way over reason to explain since ive provided plenty of reliable sources i am not vandalizing and i tried to reach a resolution with the author therefore you do not know what youre talking about youre in danger of being reevaluated by wiki if you continue to defend a sperson who clearly is too stubborn to work with others on wiki and who deletes very reliable sources such action speaks little about you as a wiki volunteer i urge that you to cease defending this person for whatever personal reasons you may have and be a true wiki volunteer otherwise ill be forced to request that wiki block you and i would not want that and neither do you,0

this is not an encyclopedia article especially this bit armed once again with a song that possesses all the classic attributes of a successful eurovision entry a catchy feelgood melody and a keychange that builds up to a big finish name is highly likely to enter the contest as one of the favourites this is more like a newspaper article it should be removed names fame is also not worthy of mention in an encyclopedia we might as well start writing about the grocer or shopowner round the corner,0

proposed page move volleyball at the summer olympics mens tournament volleyball at the summer olympics mens indoor tournament volleyball at the summer olympics womens tournament volleyball at the summer olympics womens indoor tournament beach volleyball at the summer olympics mens tournament volleyball at the summer olympics mens beach tournament beach volleyball at the summer olympics womens tournament volleyball at the summer olympics womens beach tournament volleyball in the olympic context seems to refer to both volleyball in general and indoor volleyball specifically i think we need to clarify this and create a uniform pattern for the names of these articles since both indoor and beach volleyball are presented in volleyball at the summer olympics article and the sports are basically the same the prefix bit should be uniform hence this proposal when this issue is decided we can go on with the older olympics tournaments which follow neither of the above name patterns,0

name pic hi jacoplame the picture of name that you agreed to post has now been given the correct copyrightfree status at flickr it turns out the picture of hari currently on the article is not actually him i emailed him and he looked at it and informed me of this see the discussion page so as soon as you could correct it that would be great its probably best not to unfreeze the page though there is still no consensus since the user felixfelix who has in the past inserted libellous falsehoods and the current fake picture into the entry is refusing any offers of a compromise as you can see if you check out the discussion page he has declared that he wants to unilaterally delete any of the critics he disagrees with and wants to quote only the one group he happens to agree with medialens name r from meth productions,0
looks good for now gotta go now though,0

cleanest city it is surprising that trivandrum is out of but that surely is not a good ranking like name suggested being in the top deserves to be called one of the cleanest also cleanliness is not just about clean it is about pollution waste treatment etc i suggest that one of the cleanest should be removed best airport i am not sure what this means this tag was given well before the new terminal was inaugurated i cannot understand how one could rate the old trv terminals as one of the best if looks is the yardstick heremost of the airports have modern terminals now and we should wait for a ranking of all the new terminals also the statement does not say on what grounds it is the best airport in terms of revenue traffic profits passenger traffic facilities if you would like to retain it please be more specific and of course have the references ready cheapest and closest option i would suggest rephrasing this to one of the closest options to maldives and name and the only direct option to maldives you can always use a connecting flight is what i am trying to say for instance someone in the uae can fly to colombo and catch a flight from there to mv mountainwhiskey,0

some small communist and fascist groups are definitely cults some larger ideological groups may contain a cultic core or special formations organized in a cultlike fashion according to some accounts the third international operatives from various countries in the 1930s were treated virtually as cult zombies by names cynical bureaucrats arguably himmlers ss included cultic formations trained at that castle wewelsburg where they supposedly performed something called the ceremony of the stifling air possibly this is a street legend as to north korea it is definitely a totalitarian state with an intense leadercult religion probably the most intense such formation that has ever existedone hesitates to describe it as a namestyle personality cult since even name never strove for such a level of quasireligious worship and regimentation but im not sure the term political cult is appropriate in reference to north korea since the term has been used up until now exclusively to refer to relatively small groups that dont wield state power and that employ elaborate psychological manipulation of their followers as a substitute for the patronage and secretpolice power of a postrevolutionary statedking name sept,0
i pretty much agree in fact i was just linking kode9 because i saw the ref when reading the entry page and i know he has a page kode9 and name are certainly both notable and the inspiration of ballard is quite interesting but is probably a good subject for a magazine article not a wikipedia one certainly more pov than it should be i think many good articles are spoiled by vainglorious mentions of friends bands so i can see where you are coming from wouldnt this suggest removing the whole para though if we are going to have the para referring to kode9 surely it is right to link to his page,0

november utc from the boston globename a democrat who won reelection as an independent also said he wants to be called an independent democrata strong backer of the iraq war name was returned to office on election day with strong gop support he ran as an independent after he lost the democratic primary in august to namehe said yesterday on nbcs meet the press that he will begin his new term as a democrat because it would make him part of the congressional leadership the senator is in line to become chairman of the homeland security and governmental affairs committeeim going to caucus with the democrats both because its good for my constituents in connecticut because i retained my seniority i become a committee chair but also i want to continue to work to bring the party back to its historic traditions of strength on national security foreign policy and innovation and progress in domestic policy name saidhe said that because voters returned him to capitol hill as an independent i am now an independent democrat capital i capital d matter of fact the secretary of the senate called my office and asked how do you want to be identified and thats it independent democrat the senator saidwith many senate democrats having campaigned or raised money for name as the partys nominee name acknowledged that it might be a little awkward for him back in washingtonthey played by the traditional partisan political playbook and i cant say i enjoyed it but were all grownups weve got a job to do and im going to do my best to get that job done name saiddemocrats will hold a edge in the senate so name the democratic nominee for vice president in could find himself courted by republicanshe was asked about the possibility that he might switch caucuses if he became uncomfortable as democrats sought to enforce party discipline particularly if the gop offered to keep him as a committee chairman and respect his seniorityim not ruling it out but i hope i dont get to that point and and i must say and with all respect to the republicans who supported me in connecticut nobody ever said were doing this because we we want you to switch over he saidi believe that the american people are considering both major political parties to be in a kind of probation because theyre understandably angry that washington is dominated too much by partisan political games and not enough by problemsolving and patriotism which means put the country and your state first name saidin senator name addition by names secret garden d of vermont abandoned the gop and aligned himself with the democrats putting them in control of the evenly divided senate the switch made him a hero among democrats and a traitor among republicansname said senator name of virginia listed himself as an independent democrat in the late 1970s before that the last senator to use the designation was in the mid19th century he saidlink,0
thom hartmann states that in germany people fill in handmarked ballots which are handcounted by civil servants watched over by volunteer representatives of the political parties its totally clean and easily audited and even though it takes a week or more to count the vote the german people know the election results the night the polls close because the news media s exit polls for two generations have never been more than a tenth of a percent off unfortunately hes wrong generally all votes are counted twice by midnight then the preliminary final results are announced and the candidates who won are contacted so they can state whether they accept their seats or not they have a week to reply and then the final results are announced its got nothing to do with counting votes for a week btw the final result of the election as a whole can take even more time because somtimes some precincts vote later than the other this year a candidate died in dresden after the ballots had been finalised and therefore the precinct voted two weeks later,0

mainland asia includes the lower basin of chinas yangtze river as well as korea but being specific is fine too i just found a citation for a more comprehensive dna study by hammer below rather than our generarizations and speculation so far citation for name culture was brought to japan by migrants from korea who in turn trace their roots to southeast asiasouth china dna study by hammer describes the name migration from korea based on the osry genes and other genes with close lineage haplogroups om122 and om95 reiterates that the entire o haplogroup has been proposed to have a southeast asian origin their definition of southeast asia includes southern china then hypothesizes that the dispersals of neolithic farmers from southeast asia also brought haplogroup o lineages to korea and eventually to japan in the concluding paragraph it states we propose that the name y chromosomes descend from prehistoric farmers that had their origins in southeastern asia perhaps going back to the origin of agriculture in this region hammers dna study is based on a global sample consisted of males from asian populations including six populations sampled from across the japanese archipelago,0

more description of location please hello i wondered if someone with the requisite local knowledge would please consider adding a short sentence maybe in the description section to explain where this bridge is i do appreciate that its location is already described in the lead as crossing between things x and y but if you dont already know name well or recently this is not necessarily all that helpful i was wondering if you could write a more bottomup description which says something like the bridge crosses the tees at blah or near blah street etc it is a hundred metres downstream from the foo bridge and b hundred metres upstream from the bar barrage or whatever which it seems to me would nail it in more empirical terms what do you think any yes of course the maps link does nail it assuming the coordinates are right but something in the text which helps in this way would i think be very useful i may be being unusually thick happens all the time actually but on my first reading and i was last in name in you see i was not at all sure where it was wondering if in fact it replaced the other rather nice pedestrian bridge closer to the town centre i cured this uncertainty by looking at the maps yes but the sentence im asking for would have given me more direct access to the knowledeg go on please write it for me you know you want to and i will go and put the kettle on for you thanks and best wishes,0

also the entire contents of wpouting which relates to any attempt to identify another editor your posts to this persons userpage clearly imply you think you know who they are in real life and feel the need to reveal this knowledge on wikipedia i manifestly did not threaten to reveal this knowledge on wikipedia where it is wellknown to be against the rules thanks to this block i am considering posting offsite you cannot silence someone and then ask that they honor your rules i will either post here within the rules or post elsewhere without them your suggestion that another editor is a known liar based purely on your sayso is also a breach of the oftenabused wpcivil it is only based purely on my sayso because you will not allow the evidence to be introduced per rule the first above which im fine with insofar as it goes but dont then turn around and say i have no evidence,0

this is ridiculous such a condition does not exist according to any policies or guidelines it isnt my fault that you cant see the obvious i havent seen you blocking name when he accused name of being a sock claiming it s so obvious in spite of the fact that he has provided no such evidences at all name was consequently banned when vartan discovered that he was a genuine user neither have i seen you block him when name was claimed to be a sock again without any evidences provided as a consequence name was also banned i have better things to do than wasting all my time at a time like christmas and the days following to document further something which is so obvious i also find it weird that all your interventions have always been to support one side against the other as can be confirmed by your edit history accusations without convincing evidences are what should be condemned like those of name s every time a genuine user appears accusations should exist when we are facing with an obvious sock which is the case with ehud and i will not be waiting weeks until you read anything at all this condition is unacceptable and i will not be contesting my block either i know it will be plainly rejected or the request being ignored until the block is waved i dont expect anything anymore its plain fishy vartan gets the restriction i get blocked the next day for ridiculous incidences which is absolutely nothing in comparison with what has happened with atabek it should be obvious that a block is too harsh of a punishment for accusation of sockpuppetry especially when there is an ample amount of evidence of such sockpuppetry furthermore a block should be preceded by an official warning on the users page with the clear notice that the user will be blocked next time a simple request on other pages doesnt satisfy this and also just because the administrators have not concluded that a user is a sockpuppet doesnt mean there is no basis for such sockpuppetry,0

changes to this page open discussion since my first contribution over two months ago i have been trying my best to make known my views on what improvements could be made to this page after an initial consultation with an administrator i decided to be bold and start a d menagement of all that had nothing to do with the city of paris i was met with opposition over a link and after being complained about i thought it best to put things back the way they were until i could get a good feel of the general concensus of the pages contibutors i have seen little concensus but a lot of silent stalling my goal here is not to control anything as was complained to one of the administrators i would like only to contribute to making a better page i have learned much from other paris pages and pages concerning french history namely those concerning the french kings but those are well covered as far as knowledgable contributors are concerned and are in little need of improvement so i had little to do there this page on the other hand i find lacking and see many things that could be improved the most important fault this page has is its quantity of specialised information far too much for a general paris page the search function is a very important element of namepedia and with this in mind much on this page is redundant and unneccessary those looking for paris economy will type exactly that into the search window the same for paris history or paris fashion here i am but repeating what i have already written below in short in order to make this page a comprehensible tool for one looking for a lead from the subject of paris or one totally ignorant on the subject in other words one who knows only enough to type only paris into the search window i propose to move the more specialty information to their own pages my apologies to those who have contributed the more detailed information but this would be better suited to a specialty page of its own this would even be a positive move as it would allow the contributor knowledgable in the subject of his contribution to expand his input far beyond what could be contained on this one page the irony of the sort is that though i contribute to name it wont be to this page in any quantity my specialty is the history of paris and i cannot even think to add that knowledge here paris history has a page of its own just to give you all a clear idea of where my aims are here i would like to contribute in the interest of clear information i hope with this post to create an opportunity for improvement please answer with any ideas you would have with this post i would also like to sound the board to see whether it is an interest for information or partisanship that holds the upper hand on this page as what i have seen to date leaves room for doubt in your answers i hope for evidence to the contrary please feel free to forward any thoughts on the matter at all addendum you can find a proposition for restructuring here please keep in mind that this is only a structure reference marked only by short notes i dont really want to cut everthing out,0
i agree if its well written there are only two known plot holes though and they created an entire section about it i just felt kinda skeptical as to whether or not it could really hold out as an entire section there was also question as to whether or not it was trivia though i do think it would work well intergrated into a section about the plot of the movie do you think it should have its own section swan,0

i have found the original answer in the archives garbage historic after intervention of t bel here it comes dear val who is also a mormon or a parrots aint sure i found very strange that each time i am answering to one wikipedianmormons question it is another who react to it instead of the one to whom it is adress to i do not see why you are defending stand point who are not at all being made by you nor why you feel the urge to respond for another one than you i think that the person concern name is grown up enough to do so on its own unless next time i am under attack you take the relay and answer that one for me as well it could be interesting if you have something to say say it so but use your own words idea and language instead of making a copy paste of my entire edit as you have nothing at all to add to it and in fact seems clearly to dont know what to say so do the wisest just shut up it is in fact evident that you do not have understood one word of what has been sayed and as you can see repeating it indefinitely like rot speach is not going to give you the ability to understand all you do is agressing agressing personal attacks and agressing try to use half as much of your energy to understand what this is about and i am sure that you might see some light i do not think that my statements can be make clearer than they already are and that your reaction more than a physical unhability to comprehend expose your reticence at accepting things you just dont want to accept you cannot accuse me of talking in circle when you are the one doing so as it can be very clearly seen in your edit as for you stupid accusation of me not being sophie what about you are you val or are you rama or are you dgl626 there is a lot of name on wiki and all of them cover up a real name they are all a pseudonym meaning they are anonymous so if i take the name anonymous as a pseudo i will be as hiding and as showing as you are because at the end in both case it is a pseudonym with nothing to do with the person real name and identity so what are you trying to proove except the fact that you were unable to figure what i just told you on your own i had a name this name seems now to be unavailable and i dont feel to make it again or take another following wiki rules all are equal on wiki old rats as well as newbees name and even arb com and board members and admi are as equal as usual wikipedian thought they have much more power than them and abuse of this power constantly without bad conscience and have learn to twist and bend all wiki rules behond recognition so who are you trying to fool with your wiki neutrality and wiki equality who is wikis first rule it is all a lie how can you claim equality with another if you have more power than this other and power on this person and can exclude this person from the group it isnt equality it is power struggle it is adversity and supremacy and group pressure as here wiki is oppression and extinction of the freedom of expression it is so corrupt that not one admi found it disturbing nor strange to banish or revert a user edit to impose his own point of view on the sacro sankt name of wikis neutrality and equality ha ha make me laught but dont think you can trick me at believing such lies please in the future avoid using words that you do not fully understand as logic for your knowledge english is one of the easiest language to learn so stop affirming stuff like that gratuitiously do some research first i speak languages english danish french german norvegian swedish occitan latin greek and geek of them fluently the others as pocket use like german i can read a book but i dont have spoken it for some years so it might take me weeks to get back the rythm as a nativ american your knowledge of foreign languages is zero maybe hightened if you are a mormon who have been on mission outside the us but you have absolutely no experience of the process of learning new languages in europe from age we choose between languages english german and spanish at age we have to chose another one and choose between english german spanish italian russian from age when we begin graduate school we have to take another one and chose between those named before and also chineese and modern american and a dialect or local language and can also take hebrew to languages are part of the compulsory pensum i also took extra english dialect as the one spoken by semi natives in australia and english dialect spoken in india that was for learning,0

banging your head against a wall hi i see name has been leaving messages on your page with his false concern about the rules and supposed reasonableness in reality name is a rabid zionist and is trying to purge wikipedia of any negative information about zionism and is trying to paint muslims in a bad light along with many of his cohorts the problem is that name is part of the wikipedia cabal when there were elections despite massive efforts to the contrary a number of people got a higher vote percentage than name but name put him on arbcom anyhow jimbo has shown his true colors as well these people control wikipedia they are all together and attacking you no one is coming to your aid this is because they control wikipedia with jimbo at the center and have more or less driven off everyone else you are banging your head against a wall here any massacre by zionists against palestinians will be covered up disorted justified etc anyone who attacks an israeli soldier will be castigated here my suggestion is to direct your efforts to somewhere more creative like a wiki encyclopedia that is not prozionist and antimuslim like this one or if you do continue here for a little bit to spend less time it is better to waste hours of time accomplishing nothing than eventually you will give up here everyone does you are fighting a losing battle,0

accents although the cartoon established mario and luigi to be from brooklyn a fact commonly accepted by fans despite having never been mentioned in any games name seemed to speak with a thicker brooklyn accent the accents werent mentioned in the games but the tv show was presumably a licensed product until nintendo decided to go with an italian accent fans assumed the tv show and later the movie accent was the official standing only when nintendos products included digitized recorded speech did anyone realize nintendo intended them to be italian not italianamerican its the same principle of updated canon that star trek and star wars licensed products run on,0

bad news bad news there are getting to be increasingly more wikipedians who want georgia country moved to georgia as if it didnt need disambiguation as indicated on talkgeorgia please tell them the following message if i do it myself the probability that they will listen is less likely because im not a registered wikipedian this is the english version of wikipedia article titles should be npov to regions where there is a large englishspeaking population such as the united states if georgia country moves to georgia it certainly is less npov in the united states and the regions where it is more npov are in asia where there are not many regions where large englishspeaking populations are found it would be logical to move georgia country to georgia in the georgian wikipedia but not the english wikipedia jun utc,0

thanks very much for the restored toungoo map borders its close enough but i wish its possible to use increasingly lighter shades eg youve followed the presentday border more or less for the chinese border which i suppose is a reasonable representation of the line of control but the reality was that there was a huge overlap across the line anaukpetlun and thalun controlled some of name campaigns on top of presentday name and east of bhamo though not as extensive or deeper into yunnan as did name likewise all the sawbwas in modern kachin state and sawbwas in northern name also paid dual tribute but since its not technically feasible i guess well just have to provide an explanation on this a number of locations are offsome by a lot name ava kyaukse nyangshwe pegu and name also please add the cities of name and name in name name was the easternmost possession name name was the capital of northern name the burmese divided name into two again thanks very much for the help regards,0
mexico a regional power i dont agree that mexico is a regional power at least of latin america it could be a regional power of central america but nowadays it is considered to be part of north america in the other areas of the world the article is divided between east west north south not between ethnic or languagegroups if this was the case in europe it could be considered latin germanic slave and even anglosaxon groups if we consider this in the americas case it should be south america and not latin america second case mexico has a great gdp but in overal terms gdp is not the only factor we should consider military power projection and foreign policy mexico has a ridiculous military and projection power and politically is a subalternous nation to the usa argentina venezuela or colombia have greater military and power projection capabilities historically they have been much more interventionous and agressive toward other nations than mexico and today we can see the same specially in venezuela case may personally i agree with you but you need sources to say it this encyclopedia is not a place for orignal research furthemore editors have produced sources saying mexico is a regional power of latin america if we change it to south america there would be no place in wich to put mexico besides brazils influence is not restricted to south america it would not make sense to say it is restricted since the sources dont agree,0
slr chronology bibliography is complete hi murderwatcher1 this is paul1513 again this is to let you know that i have completed the slr chronology bibliography for you and that i am going to try to upload a pdf copy to your talk page as soon as i finish this note this may take a while because ive never uploaded a pdf before youre absolutely right it would be great if some of the old modern photography stuff could be added to wikipedia however you can be sure that theyre still under copyright pre american workforhire copyrights are generally years and on years the real question is who owns the copyright today since modern went under there have been many media company sales and resales the present copyright holder would be hell to uncover and ask permission in fact the current owner might not even know that it owns moderns copyrights orphaned copyrights are a major unresolved fair use issue in the information age speaking of first cameras mine was a simple name pointandshoot my parents gave it to me for getting straight as in the 5th grade it was of course a bad camera but it opened up a world of possibilities from the name i eventually learned about the existence of the pentax auto slr it was then one step to mm slrs and i got a nikon fe2 in the fe2 is also the reason why the bulk of my modern photography magazine citations begin around im sorry to hear about your disputes with the admins over your nonphotography wkipedia entries it would be unfortunate if you felt compelled to end your wikipedia activities over them perhaps you could start a blog or create a myspace or facebook page to air these issues without worrying about what the admins want however i will respect whatever your decision is as i fully understand that the most sophisticated machine is nothing next to a human life you can reach me on my talk page thanks muchly,0

unblock i am appealing a hour block that was placed on me before i could post my response via the administrators message board i apologize in advance for the length of this but i believe that its necessary to include all of these details i wrote a summary at the end so that administrators could get an overview if they dont have time to read the whole statement i will be addressing the claim that i violated the 1rr rule in the second paragraph of this article according to wpblp biographies of living persons must be written conservatively and with regard to a subjects privacy in a book written in a foreign language with a lot of jargon there are often competing translationsinterpretations and a book written in such a hotspot is sure to generate numerous quotes misquotes dubious translation and outofcontext statements as per wpblp i think it stands to reason that a more conservative and less sensationalist translation be used and for the same reason the quotes should not be taken out of the context that the book uses them in with than in mind on the 18th of february i improved certain parts of the paragraph in question in order to make to make it more compatible with wpblp based on this source username responded to one of my edits by stating that enwikipediaorgwindexphptitleyitzchakginsburghdiff oldid i cant read and in what seemed to be extremely inappropriate comment for a wikipedia administrator told me in as many words to get off wikipediatake a break i didnt take nicely to being told that by an administrator and thus began a heated series of exchanges during which i was told by said individual that i had behavioral problems said individual also decided to respond to my comments by invoking what seemed to me to intimidation tactics i started to write a complaint against you why do i need to know that he can let me know when he posts it and then later responding to another edit he didnt like by saying that it was on my charge sheet now the reason i am writing about the behavior of said individual is to give some context or the 1rr issue after posting my version of the paragraph username subsequently changed it to this i will post only the first few words of his statement and the source source there is a reason to kill babies on the enemy side username babies on the enemy side may be killed after those first few words username continues quoting the rest of the paragraph now at best this is a serious distortion and when you consider that article is dealing with a scholarly work which contains hundreds of sometimes competing sometimes contradictory sources rationales theories proposals and ideas many of which are subsequently discounted limited in scope or just tossed by the wayside the disparity the statement may be done and there is a reason is even greater aside from the distortion mentioned above in contradiction to wpblp username also opted for a particularly liberal outofcontext translation why did username replace my edit with his own his statement prefer source with an actual quotation as i showed above he didnt use an actual quotation furthermore after seeing his comment i searched but wasnt able to find any wikipedia reference to a such a preference leading me to believe that he was intent on just superimposing his own wpjustdontlikeit on me without explanation his actions above combined with the general hostility cited above led me to be believe that this was another front in the multipronged campaign of intimidation that he was engaging in ie encouraging me take a breaknewlin,0

edit summary when editing an article on wikipedia there is a small field labelled edit summary under the main editbox it looks like this the text written here will appear on the recent changes page in the page revision history on the diff page and in the watchlists of users who are watching that article see mhelpedit summary for full information on this feature when you leave the edit summary blank some of your edits could be mistaken for vandalism and may be reverted so please always briefly summarize your edits especially when you are making subtle but important changes like changing dates or numbers thank you i do when im doing anything more than grammar the only exception to this would be on name of lovat of which im the only editor at present and i didnt think to add edit summaries otherwise i believe that i have done so if you have any particular situations in which i have failed to do so id be happy to explain myself id much appreciate it see it for yourself green bars are for edit summaries red bars are for edits with no summaries thats quite a nifty tool there im fully aware of edit summaries i dont provide edit summaries on my own talk page or my user page i also dont usually provide them on other users talk pages in earlier editing i didnt take the summary seriously if youre referring to anything from several months ago or more i do apologize like i said if you have any particular situations where you believe i missed one please bring them up to me i would sincerely like to know otherwise i dont see what youre trying to accomplish here i think the link speaks for itself as for what im trying to accomplish i think my original comment explained just that if you were trying to just helpfully remind me i thank you though i dont think it was needed i saw the page it didnt say anything to me except that i finally know my edit count if you really want to get a point across to me i suggest you do so blatantly if your original comment explained your motives then we are done here your nonsense page if you are interested in archiving your old talk you may want to review wikipediahow to archive a talk page accusing other editors of defacing your talk page for politely reminding you of wikipedia policies against personal attacks does not demonstrate good faith on your part and will only make you look bad i suggest you move the archive to a more appropriate name like user talkcanaenarchive1 furthermore making negative comments about discussion by other editors and claiming that their edits are not worth reading shows that you arent interested in abiding by wpnpa wpciv nor wpeq if you want to improve your working relationship with other editors it might help to avoid incivility im not interested in archiving my old talk as of yet but thank you for the suggestion i use nonsense in a lot of ways other people do not because i find a lot of other words to be boring at present likewise instead of cool or awesome or thats interesting im currently in the habit of referring to things as nifty its something i do i know how to archive a talk page ive done it before i still do not consider suggesting ignorance to be a personal attack because ive grown up in a rather intellectual atmosphere im not going to change just because a few people are offended at my words i thought that this was resolved by now i have quite decent relationships with other working editors it seems that a particular user and myself simply do not get along it is regretful but something which seems to be if someone takes offence to my creation of a nonsense page they can bring it up to me personally as you,0

i was requested to provide an opinion here by comfykem everyone agrees that virus species and genera are inherently different usual practice for a genus with a single species would be to construct a single article to cover both and thats sensible where the pair would otherwise duplicate each other however theres no reason in principle why each cant have an article as long as there is sufficient distinctive reliably sourced material in each to merit that this appears to be the case here just about though bloating the lloviu virus article with speculative information about what the virus particle might look like appears unhelpful if we are to have a single article on a genus with a single species as name suggests it would probably be best to have it at the species name as that is what the bulk of readers are most likely to search for,0
marnanel your talking nonsense there is no dispute in the real world money magazine wrote that article after complaints were made is now out dated stevensons legal battles have been settled for some time all the text vary from each other which is reflected on the page there is no dispute between powers and myself her attorneys were contacted and since then her products have reverted to her particular text only the problem was these people thought they could cheat me and they got caught now they have suffered terrible embarassment over it the matter has been resolved and i am not willing to sacrifice my legacy with the public hog washing these stories enough is enough money magazine never interviewed one single author for that story my legacy does not revolve around money magazine but my authorship and if you want to present the footprints poem in the name you must show the chronology of the poems history what is it that you need to present reliable source to this article be specific i removed my published book from world wide marketing is that enough proof of authorship for you if so then see authorhouse for details or contact me thank you name,0

belated merry christmas and hello from nsrinivasan a few submissions on contradictions in indian history pages thanks for your affirmative action in unlocking history pages dear tiptoety i request you to have a careful look at the pages of history edited by user dinesh kannambadi who while claiming to source material from reliable sources is at the same time indulging in feeding of completely unverified and unreliable pieces of information this communication from me may kindly be regarded by you as one among a series of interactions with you with my sole aim being the betterment of history pages of wikipedia and nothing else it has been my experience while trying to contribute to history pages or indeed indulge in discussions for betterment of wikipedia pages whatever we do users like dinesh kannambadi have objected to always and have branded our contributions as vandalism and sourcing from pov websites etc just take note of the contradictory nature of his editing of history pages especially on the chalukya empires especially with reference to the chola empire pls also remember that in wikipedia for god knows what reason the pages on the chola empire have been christened as chola dynasty despite that the fact that the cholas prospered at the helm of an empire having large territories not just in india but also overseas including name maldives very large parts of south east asia for at least years of their existence here are the examples but before that i would like to say this that deliberately user dinesh kannambadi has been trying to mention or project the chalukya dynasty as some sort of a contemporary of the chola empire and has even gone on to mention the demise of the chola empire saying that the chola territories were taken over by the pandiyas which has a great weakness the chalukya dynasty had very weak kings from onwards and between to their kings were displaced and the name under name i and name ii ruled name country in india the chalukyas did make a comeback but that was for just years between to after which they went into oblivion i request that you may kindly contrast this with the fate of the cholas whose kings from ad though were not as strong as their kings between ad yet one of their last great kings kulothunga iii on the strength of epigraphical and inscriptional evidence is said to have occupied madurai karur and name then known as ilangai between ad he ruled for around years though near the end of his rule he was indeed routed by the pandiyans and held on to his empire with great difficulty having hoysalas as his allies yet even with weak kings following him after the cholas lasted till when their last king lost to the pandiyas and the cholas went into oblivion contrast the above ie the demise of the cholas in or to that of the chalukyas who were first of all without a capital for over years and reemerged for just years and became history by ad or thereabouts yet jingoism seems to get the better of user dinesh kannambadi and he has written in the western chalukya empire page as under the link is and the relevant portion of text is the following this period saw the fall of two great empires the chalukyas of the western deccan and the cholas of tamilakam on the ruins of these two empires were built the name of their feudatories whose mutual antagonisms filled the annals of deccan history for over a hundred years the pandyas taking control over some regions of the erstwhile chola empire though technically speaking at least as per the version of dinesh kannambadi the chalukyas fell and demised in and the cholas demised after almost decades in about ie within a hundred years of each other i would like to raise the question what is the justification for his expression this period saw the fall of two great empires i mean what is meant by this period surely if both empires had fallen within two or three decades of each other then the expression could be a little contemporaneous but even as a weak empire the cholas lasted till almost years after the chalukyas demised then what is the reason and justification for mentioning the demise of the cholas when the subject on the page ie the chalukya dynasty which went into oblivion in the year or the point is that whether it is mentioning the hoysalas another name empire or the chalukyas he is obsessed with their portrayals as some sort of contemporaries of the cholas even while mentioning chalukya architecture user dinesh kannambadi cannot resist bringing in the cholas see this write u,0

the article could definitely use some refinement but you are basing your edits on the work of fringe authors like name namey and name none of them are reliable sources and much of what they write is spurious nonsense another problem with your edits is that you are padding the article with too much tangential fluffy details that do not need to be here,0

captions tell the history of an aircraft if you are going to have a picture of an aircraft then you need to tell its story and background this is only common sense if not for readability then for accuracy in reference if you were to google f this article is one of the first to be found so this make accuracy and completeness essential in these article and it does not add too much more in size if wikipedia was a dictionary then a simple caption would be ok but tbut wikipedia is more then it is becoming a valuable reference tool as such accuracy and details is essential,0

merger proposal i propose that list of deans of ilr school be merged into cornell university ilr school i think that the list could easily be just a table in the history section of this article and theschool article is of a reasonable size in which the merging of list of deans will not cause any problems as far as article size or undue weight is concerned,0

is this a press release with her trademark pageboy bob haircut and sunglasses wintour has become an important figure in much of the fashion world widely praised for her eye for fashion trends and her support for younger designers her reportedly aloof and demanding personality has earned her the nickname nuclear wintour im sorry but that reads ridiculous and has no sources to any of those claims who has widely praised her who says she is important and the word reportedly reportedly by whom where is a source for her nickname is her pageboy bob really trademarked also the followingshe is the eldest daughter of name editor of the london evening standard her father consulted her on how to make the newspaper relevant to the youth of the era so she was a newspaper consultant i find it hard to believe that her fathera grown man would consult a youth on how to make a newspaper relevant to anyone where are sources for this i guess i will start looking for sources and removing non sourced statements tomorrow if anyone wants to help please help me i have only read paragraphs on this wikipedia page about name so i am wondering what else needs to be fixed i will read more tomorrow well you could have asked me per the template at the top of this page everything in that name is repeated often in greater detail in the article and sourced to the best of my recollection the general rule is that we dont footnote something in the name section unless its an extraordinary claim like the most the oldest that sort of thing unless thats the only place in the article it appears see wpleadcite,0

the message i left on your talk page begins i notice that one of the first articles you have edited appears to be dealing with a topic with which you may have a conflict of interest emphasis added your choice of username gives the impression that you are a representative of the subject of the only article which you have edited your username should represent you not any other group if you edit or create an article which is virtually identical to your username especially when you have made no other edits at all other editors will quite naturally assume a conflict of interest,0

no seriousy the only thing i think actually did or said against your precious wikipedia policies was saying that if i really had my way half of you would be shot ignoring for a while the fact that i was obviously joking it happens to be my religious belief that the human race on a whole would be much much better off if of the population died tomorrow that doesnt mean i go around killing people or making specific death threats against individuals and dont you actually have the sense to realize that if someone says oh my god you are such a fucking idiot just go die already that they probably dont want you to die or more accurately they dont care very few people actually have the emotion required to sit and pray for the death of another person or group of people and i am not one of those people if you really wanted to show off what a horrible and insensitive person i am edit which was on a wiki talk page is probably not the best name nothing pisses me off more than people who see letters like and and automatically assume that whatever is written is russian the cyrillic alphabet is used in many slavic languages as well as central asian former soviet republics and even mongolia so i called someone an idiot boo fucking hoo maybe he could have said what language is that instead of assuming that it was russian however insulted he was by me calling him an idiot i can guarantee you that i was at least times as insulted by him calling that russian i am a proud native russian and will not have my culture besmirched with these allegations your other example how i am a bad contributor is what a spelling correction or was it the fact that my edit summary was how i felt about the sad fact that niggers cant spell dont even think about raising issue of my use of the word i live in harlem around here that word is used like a comma and before you try to tell me the difference between nigga and nigger there is none its called a dialect while for some purposes it makes sense to write things phonetically as they are pronounced by the person saying them i find it is usually clearer to spell properly also a nigger to me at least is not a black person i am not a racist i do not even draw distinctions between people in my holy opinion there is a nigger inside of all of us people like you for instance who take offense for no reason i mean was saying black people are stupid and i think they should be marginalized in society tarred and feathered strung up on trees dragged through town by their enormous wangs etc no and if that is what you heard id like to know why are you black of the black people i know personally use the word nigger more than i do are why we as a society still cant get over the silly idea that words are harmful words are not harmful ideas are harmful one particularly harmful idea is that certain words are so unspeakably horrible that nobody can be allowed to say them for any reason at all you want to end racism forever stop freaking the fuck out every time you see the word nigger name i happen to be a priest and a docktor and saving humanity is just one of my many responsibilities name like you make me hate it but i still do it thats what a good person i am i forgot what else i was going to complain about i mean i could complain about everything on wikipedia not because i am uncivil but because there are enough name to make this community unbearable for normal welladjusted individuals such as myself if you look at all my page edits they were all good for the encyclopedia ok there was one tiny exception a long time ago i saw someone changed a caption on scottish fold to winston churchill someone else reverted it and i reverted it back i felt it was an appropriate caption to that particular image but everything else was beneficial to improving the quality of the content i may be a little hard on people who are hung up on things that are wrong but i only do what is right that is why i put it on my user page i dont do wrong things if you try to argue with me you will be in for a world of hurt butthurt to be exact but you have nobody to blame but yourself unlike you i actually warn people first but no you fags have to be humorless oversensitive fascist wikipedos with your unwarranted selfimportance and your administrative powers well you can go fuck yourselves if you ever succeed in getting all sand out of your vaginas i joined wikipedia because i wanted to make it better and that was all i did but i guess you cunts actually enjoy bathing aro,1
